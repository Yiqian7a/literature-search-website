Here we map tropical dry forest height (RMSE =0.9 m, R-2 = 0.84, range 0.6-7 m), and we map foliage height profiles, with a time series of Landsat and Advanced Land Imager (ALI) imagery on the island of Eleuthera, The Bahamas, substituting time for vertical canopy space. We also simultaneously map forest disturbance type and age. We map these variables in the context of avian habitat studies, particularly for wintering habitat of an endangered Nearctic-Neotropical migrant bird, the Kirtland\'s Warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii). We also illustrate relationships between forest vertical structure, disturbance type and counts of forage species important to the Kirtland\'s Warbler. The ALI imagery and the Landsat time series are both critical to the result for forest height, which the strong relationship of forest height with disturbance type and age facilitates. Also unique to this study is that seven of the eight image time steps are cloud-cleared images: mosaics of the clear parts of several cloudy scenes. We created each cloud-cleared image, including a virtually seamless ALI image mosaic, with regression tree normalization. We also illustrate how viewing time series imagery as red-green-blue composites of tasseled cap wetness (RGB wetness composites) aids reference data collection for classifying tropical forest disturbance type and age. Our results strongly support current Landsat Program production of co-registered imagery, and they emphasize the value of seamless time series of cloud-cleared imagery.

In this study, we devised an approach called the Two-Step Filtering (TSF) for detecting the phenological stages of maize and soybean from time-series Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m observations. The TSF method consists of a Two-Step Filtering scheme that includes: (i) smoothing the temporal WDRVI data with a wavelet-based filter and (ii) deriving the optimum scaling parameters from shape-model fitting procedure. The date of key crop development stages are then estimated by using the optimum scaling parameters and an initial value of the specific phenological date on the shape model, which are preliminary defined in reference to ground-based crop growth stage observations. The shape model is a crop-specific WDRVI curve with typical seasonal features, which were defined by averaging smoothed, multi-year WDRVI profiles from MODIS 250-m data collected over irrigated maize and soybean study sites.   In this study, the TSF method was applied to MODIS-derived WDRVI data over a 6-year period (2003 to 2008) for two irrigated sites and one rainfed site planted to either maize or soybean as part of the Carbon Sequestration Program (CSP) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. A comparison of satellite-based retrievals with ground-based crop growth stage observations collected by the CSP over the six growing seasons for these three sites showed that the TSF method can accurately estimate the date of four key phenological stages of maize (V2.5: early vegetative stage, R1: silking stage, R5: dent stage and R6: maturity) and soybean (V1: early vegetative stage, R5: beginning seed, R6: full seed and R7: beginning maturity). The root mean square error (RMSE) of phenological-stage estimation for maize ranged from 2.9 [R1] to 7.0 [R5] days and from 32 [R6] to 6.9 [R7] days for soybean, respectively. In addition, the TSF method was also applied for two years (2001 and 2002) over eastern Nebraska to test its ability to characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of these key phenological stages over a larger geographic area. The MODIS-derived crop phenological stage dates agreed well with the statistical crop progress data reported by the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for eastern Nebraska\'s three crop agricultural statistic districts (ASDs). At the ASD-level, the RMSE of phenological-stage estimation ranged from 1.6 [R1] to 5.6 [R5] days for maize and from 2.5 [R7] to 5.3 [R5] days for soybean. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Repeat-pass SAR images were available from the TerraSAR-X, ERS-1/2, Envisat ASAR and ALOS PALSAR sensors. Coherence was related to measurements of burn severity (Composite Burn Index) and remote sensing estimates expressed by the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) index. In addition, the effects of topography and weather on coherence estimates were assessed. The analysis for a given range of local incidence angle showed that the co-polarized coherence increases with the increase of burn severity at X- and C-band whereas cross-polarized coherence was practically insensitive to burn severity. Higher sensitivity to burn severity was found at L-band for both co- and cross-polarized channels. The association strength between coherence and burn severity was strongest for images acquired under stable, dry environmental conditions. When the local incidence angle is accounted for the determination coefficients increased from 0.6 to 0.9 for X- and C-band. At L-band the local incidence angle had less influence on the association strength to burn severity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The lake\'s small size, highly turbid water, and covariant water constituents present a challenging case for both algorithm development and atmospheric correction. The objectives of the study are to assess the optical properties of the lake, to evaluate various atmospheric correction procedures, and to compare the performance of empirical and semi-analytical algorithms in hypertrophic water. In situ water quality parameter and radiometric measurements were made simultaneous to MERIS overpasses. Upwelling radiance measurements at depth 0 66 m were corrected for instrument self-shading and processed to water-leaving reflectance using downwelling irradiance measurements and estimates of the vertical attenuation coefficient for upward radiance, K-u, generated from a simple bio-optical model estimating the total absorption, a(lambda), and backscattering coefficients, b(b)(lambda). The normalised water-leaving reflectance was used for assessing the accuracy of image-based Dark Object Subtraction and 6S Radiative Transfer Code atmospheric correction procedures applied to MERIS Empirical algorithms for estimating chlorophyll a (Chl a), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Secchi Disk depth (z(SD)) and absorption by CDOM (a(CDOM)) were derived from simultaneously collected in situ and MERIS measurements. The empirical algorithms gave high correlation coefficient values, although they have a limited ability to separate between signals from covariant water constituents. The MERIS Neural Network algorithms utilised in the standard Level 2 Case 2 waters product and Eutrophic Lakes processor were also used to derive water constituent concentrations. However, these failed to produce reasonable comparisons with in situ measurements owing to the failure of atmospheric correction and divergence between the optical properties and ranges used to train the algorithms and those of Zeekoevlei. Maps produced using the empirical algorithms effectively show the spatial and temporal variability of the water quality parameters during April 2008 On the basis of the results it is argued that MERIS is the current optimal sensor for frequent change detection applications in inland waters. This study also demonstrates the considerable potential value for simple TOA algorithms for hypertrophic systems. It is recommended that regional algorithm development be prioritized in southern Africa and that remote sensing be integrated Into future operational water quality monitoring systems (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

For many years the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (65) radiative transfer model and the Simplified Method for Atmospheric Correction (SMAC) codes have been used for this atmospheric correction, but previous studies have shown that in a number of situations the quality of correction provided by the SMAC is low. This paper describes a method designed to improve the quality of the SMAC atmospheric correction algorithm through a slight increase in its computational complexity. Data gathered from the SEVIRI aboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) is used to validate the additions to SMAC, both by comparison to simulated data corrected using the highly accurate 6S method and by comparison to in-situ and 6S corrected SEVIRI data gathered for two field sites in Africa. The additions to the SMAC are found to greatly increase the quality of atmospheric correction performed, as well as broaden the range of atmospheric conditions under which the SMAC can be applied. When examining the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the relative difference between SMAC and in-situ values decreases by 1.5% with the improvements in place. Similarly, the mean relative difference between SMAC and 6S reflectance values decreases by a mean of 13, 14.5 and 8.5% for Channels 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Furthermore, the processing speed of the SMAC is found to remain largely unaffected, with only a small increase in the time taken to process a full SEVIRI scene. Whilst the method described within this paper is only applicable to SEVIRI data, a similar approach can be applied to other data sources than SEVIRI, and should result in a similar accuracy improvement no matter which instrument supplies the original data.

A Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) model of canopy scattering was used to examine the sensitivity of model estimates of lidar-derived canopy height, h(lidar) to signal triggering method, canopy structure, footprint size, sampling density and scanning angle, for broadleaf and conifer canopies of varying density. Detailed 3D models of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Downy birch (Betula pubescens) were used to simulate lidar response, with minimal assumptions about canopy structure. Use of such models allowed the impact of lidar parameters on canopy height retrieval to be tested under a range of conditions typically not possible in practice. Retrieved h(lidar) was generally found to be an underestimate of \'true\' canopy height, h(canopy), but with exceptions. Choice of signal triggering method caused h(lidar), to underestimate h(canopy) by similar to 4% for birch and similar to 7% for pine (up to 66% in extreme cases). Variations in canopy structure resulted on average in underestimation of h(canopy) by 13% for birch and between 29 and 48% for pine depending on age, but with over-estimates in some cases of up to 10%. Increasing footprint diameter from 0.1 to 1 m increased retrieved h(lidar) from significant underestimates of h(canopy) to values indistinguishable from h(canopy). Increased sampling density led to slightly increased values of h(lidar) to close to h(canopy), but not significantly. Increasing scan angle increased h(lidar) by up to 8% for birch, and 19% for pine at a scan angle of 30 degrees. The impact of scan angle was greater for conifers as a result of large variation in crown height. Results showed that interactions between physically modelled (hypothetical) within canopy returns are similar to findings made in other studies using actual lidar systems, and that these modelled returns can depend strongly on the type of canopy and the lidar acquisition characteristics, as well as interactions between these properties. Physical models of laser pulse/canopy interactions may provide additional information on pulse interactions within the canopy, but require validation and testing before they are applied to actual survey planning and logistics.

The integration of QuickBird multispectral imagery and LIDAR data was considered during image segmentation and the subsequent object-based classification. Three segmentation schemes were examined: (1) segmentation based solely on the spectral image layers; (2) segmentation based solely on MAR-derived layers; and (3) segmentation based on both the spectral and LIDAR-derived layers. For each segmentation scheme, objects were generated at twelve different scales in order to determine optimal scale parameters. Six categories of classification metrics were generated for each object based on spectral data alone, LIDAR data alone and the combination of both data sources. Machine learning decision trees were used to build classification rule sets. Quantitative segmentation quality assessment and classification accuracy results showed the integration of spectral and LIDAR data, in both image segmentation and object-based classification, improved the forest classification compared to using either data source independently. Better segmentation quality led to higher classification accuracy. The highest classification accuracy (Kappa 91.6%) was acquired when using both spectral- and LIDAR-derived metrics based on objects segmented from both spectral and LIDAR layers at scale parameter 250, where best segmentation quality was achieved. Optimal scales were analyzed for each segmentation-classification scheme. Statistical analysis of classification accuracies at different scales revealed that there was a range of optimal scales that provided statistically similar accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this paper is to report on an unsupervised signal processing algorithm called Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to temporally decompose MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to automatically map major crop types in three agricultural regions covering parts of Kansas and Nebraska in the US and a third in northwestern Turkey. The approach proposed here is based on the premise that the temporal profiles of individual crops are observed as mixtures with a moderate-resolution sensor when cultivated fields are smaller than the spatial resolution of the observing sensor. The purpose of ICA is to decompose these mixed observations by a remote sensor into individual crop signals, using only the mixed observations without the aid of information about the crop signatures and the mixing process. Results using both synthetic data and real observations suggest that the ICA approach can successfully separate generalized, landscape-level cropping patterns using only available temporal measurements. There is very little need to use complicated indices or derivative spectral products to map crop types using ICA: availability of high temporal observations, either as raw spectral bands or simple vegetation indices is sufficient to identify crop types at the scale of landscapes. Results also suggest that crop map predictions aggregated to coarser resolutions have better accuracy than at native resolution when compared to maps made from fine-scale observations used as ground truth. These accuracies range from RMSE of 15-30% at 500 m to less than 10% at 2000 m. The success of the initial results presented here to automatically map crop distributions across large areas using MODIS data is particularly encouraging given the existing and planned worldwide observations of agriculturally important regions. However, the use of ICA for operational crop monitoring will require algorithms that will take into account prior information on crop growth curves, constrained estimation of independent components, and scaling of mixing vectors to obtain physically possible ranges.

However, current methods for measuring structural complexity require a laborious process that involves many logistically expensive point based measurements. An automated or semi-automated method would be ideal. In this study, the utility of airborne laser scanning (LiDAR; Light Detection and Ranging) for characterizing the ecological structure of a forest landscape is examined. The innovation of this paper is to use different laser pulse return properties from a full waveform LiDAR to characterize forest ecological structure. First the LiDAR dataset is stratified into four vertical layers: ground, low vegetation (0-1 m from the ground), medium vegetation (1-5 m from the ground) and high vegetation (>5 m). Subsequently the \"Type\" of LiDAR return is analysed: Type I (singular returns); Type 2 (first of many returns); Type 3 (intermediate returns); and Type 4 (last of many returns). A forest characterization scheme derived from LiDAR point clouds is proposed. A validation of the scheme is then presented using a network of field sites that recorded commonly used metrics of biodiversity. The proposed forest characterization categories allow for quantification of gaps (above bare ground, low vegetation and medium vegetation), canopy cover and its vertical density as well as the presence of various canopy strata (low, medium and high). Regression analysis showed that LiDAR derived variables were good predictors of field recorded variables (R(2) = 0.82, P < 0.05 between LiDAR derived presence of low vegetation and field derived LAI for low vegetation). The proposed scheme clearly shows the potential of full waveform LiDAR to provide information on the complexity of habitat structure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We describe a cloud-gap-filled (CGF) daily snow-cover map using a simple algorithm to track cloud persistence, to account for the uncertainty created by the age of the snow observation. Developed from the 0.05 degrees resolution climate-modeling grid daily snow-cover product, MOD10C1, each grid cell of the CGF map provides a cloud-persistence count (CPC) that tells whether the current or a prior day was used to make the snow decision. Percentage of grid cells \"observable\" is shown to increase dramatically when prior days are considered. The effectiveness of the CGF product is evaluated by conducting a suite of data assimilation experiments using the community Noah land surface model in the NASA Land Information System (LIS) framework. The Noah model forecasts of snow conditions, such as snow-water equivalent (SWE). are updated based on the observations of snow cover which are obtained either from the MOD10C1 standard product or the new CGF product. The assimilation integrations using the CGF maps provide domain-averaged bias improvement of similar to 11%, whereas such improvement using the standard MOD10C1 maps is similar to 3%. These improvements suggest that the Noah model underestimates SWE and snow depth fields, and that the assimilation integrations contribute to correcting this systematic error. We conclude that the gap-filling strategy is an effective approach for increasing cloud-free observations of snow cover. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor offers a promising opportunity for estimating daily ET with a 1 km spatial resolution, but is hampered by frequent cloud contamination or data gaps from other factors. In this study, 1) a stand-alone ET model was applied and tested during clear or partial cloudy sky conditions using MODIS-based inputs of land surface and atmospheric data and 2) meteorological simulations by using Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation (FDDA) system between MODIS and the 5th Generation Meso-scale Meteorological Model (MM5) was used in cloudy conditions to facilitate continuous daily ET estimates. The MODIS ET algorithm modified from Mu et al. (2007) is based on the Penman-Monteith equation and was applied to predict ET at flux measurement sites. This algorithm considers both the effects of surface energy partitioning processes and environmental constraints on ET. We devised gap-filling approaches for MODIS aerosol and albedo data that were identified as bottlenecks to determine retrieval rates of insolation and ET. MODIS-derived input variables (i.e., meteorological variables and radiation components) for estimating ET showed a good agreement with flux tower observations at each site. The retrieval rate of MODIS ET doubled at four flux measurement sites after gap-filling with negligible compensation was undertaken for accuracy. In spite of the high accuracy of MODIS-derived input variables, MODIS ET showed meaningful errors at the four flux measurement sites. These errors were mainly associated with errors in the estimated canopy conductance. During clear sky conditions, MODIS was used to calculate ET, while the MODIS-MM5 FDDA system provided input variables for the calculation of ET under cloudy sky conditions. The performance of the MODIS-MM5 FDDA system was evaluated by comparing ET based on MODIS, which showed a good agreement with the MODIS Er for various land cover types. Our results indicate that MODIS can be applied to monitor the land surface energy budget and ET with reasonable accuracy and that MODIS-MM5 FDDA has the potential to provide reasonable input data of ET estimation under cloudy conditions.

Additionally. we classified band monitored how channel migrations affect the distribution of pioneer vegetation and old-growth forest. The cloud-free study area was 153,032 ha - open water plus 3 km inland on each margin. The channel migration rates, expressed as percent dislocation of the open water body of the river year(-1), were lowest in the Japura River (1.2%), and highest in the Aranapu channel (2.5%), the point bars at river confluence being the most affected landforms subject to geomorphic changes. Annual rates of lateral erosion and accretion of vegetated land along the three rivers were well-balanced. They averaged 0.79 and 0.83% of the cloud-free channel area over the 21 years. The Solimoes River was more dynamic than the Japura River, which can be traced to higher water discharge and sediment load. During the 21 years, the area covered by pioneer vegetation increased by 5.8% of the study area, while late-succession areas decreased by a similar amount (5.5%). According to local biomass estimates of the different vegetation types, these values suggest that C-releases by alluvial erosion would be much higher than C-sequestration caused by the creation of areas suitable for colonization by pioneer vegetation at our study site.

Both features related to structure and intensity were considered. The study was conducted on 197 Norway spruce and 180 birch trees (leaves on conditions) in a boreal forest reserve in Norway. The ALS sensor used was capable of recording multiple echoes. The point density was 6.6 m(-2). Laser echoes located within the vertical projection of the tree crowns. which were assumed to be circular and defined according to field measurements, were attributed to three categories: \"first echoes of many\", \"single echoes\", or \"last echoes of many echoes\". They were denoted FIRST SINGLE, and LAST respectively. In tree species classification using ALS data features should be independent of tree heights. We found that many features were dependent on tree height and that this dependency influenced selection of candidate features. When we accounted for this dependency, it was revealed that FIRST and SINGLE echoes were located higher and LAST echoes lower in the birch crowns than in spruce crowns. The intensity features of the FIRST echoes differed more between species than corresponding features of the other echo categories. For the FIRST echoes the intensity values tended to be higher for birch than spruce. When using the various features for species classification, maximum overall classification accuracies of 77% and 73% were obtained for structural and intensity features, respectively. Combining candidate features related to structure and intensity resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 88%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This allows the near-real time monitoring of fire events in Mexico and Central America. In addition to the detection of active fires, the location of hot spots are classified with respect to vegetation types, accessibility, and risk to Nature Protection Areas (NPA). Besides further analysis is necessary due to the considerable effects of forest fires on the fast detection of fires, biodiversity and human life. This fire impact assessment is crucial to support the needs of resource managers and policy makers for adequate fire recovery and restoration actions. CONABIO attempts to meet these requirements, providing post-fire assessment products as part of the management system in particular for satellite-based burnt area mapping. This paper provides an overview of the main components of the operational system and will present an outlook to future activities and system improvements, especially the development of a burnt area product.

To obtain the spectral characteristics of a standardized land area to compare with tower measurements, we scaled up the nominal 500 m MODIS products to a 2.5 km x 2.5 kin area (5 x 5 MODIS 500 m grid cells). We then used the scaled-up MODIS products in a coupled canopy-leaf radiative transfer model, PROSAIL-2, to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) by the part of the canopy dominated by chlorophyll (FAPAR(chl)) versus that by the whole canopy (FAPAR(canopy)). Using the additional information provided by flux tower-based measurements of gross ecosystem production (GEP) and incident PAR, we determined 90-minute averages for APAR and LUE (slope of GEP:APAR) for both the physiologically active foliage (APAR(chl), LUEchl) and for the entire canopy (APAR(canopy), LUEcanopy).   The flux tower measurements of GEP were strongly related to the MODIS-derived estimates of APAR(chl), (r(2)=0.78) but only weakly related to APAR(canopy) (r(2)=0.33). Gross LUE between 2001 and 2005 for LUEchl was 0.0241 mu mol C mu mol(-1) PPFD whereas LUEcanopy 6% lower. Time series of the 5-year normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to estimate the average length of the core growing season as days of year 152-259. Inter-annual variability in the core growing season LUEchl (mu mol C mu mol(-1) PPFD) ranged from 0.0225 in 2003 to 0.0310 in 2004. The five-year time series of LUEchl corresponded well with both the seasonal phase and amplitude of LUE from the tower measurements but this was not the case for LUEcanopy. We conclude that LUE,h, derived from MODIS observations could provide a more physiologically realistic parameter than the more commonly used LUEcanopy as an input to large-scale photosynthesis models.

The results show that the radar signal is slightly more sensitive to surface roughness at high incidence (50 degrees-52 degrees) than at low incidence (26 degrees-28 degrees). The difference observed in the X-band, between radar signals reflected by the roughest and smoothest areas, reaches a maximum of the order of 5.5 dB at 50 degrees-52 degrees, and 4 dB at 26 degrees-28 degrees. This sensitivity increases in the L-band with PALSAR/ALOS data, for which the dynamics of the return radar signal as a function of soil roughness reach 8 dB at HH38 degrees. In the C-band, ASAR/ENVISAT data (HH and VV polarizations at an incidence angle of 23 degrees) are characterised by a difference of about 4 dB between the signals backscattered by smooth and rough areas.   Our results also show that the sensitivity of TerraSAR-X signal to surface roughness decreases in very wet and frozen soil conditions. Moreover, the difference in backscattered signal between smooth and rough fields is greater at high incidence angles. The low-to-high incidence signal ratio (Delta sigma degrees=sigma(26 degrees-28 degrees)/sigma(50 degrees-52 degrees)) decreases with surface roughness, and has a dynamic range, as a function of surface roughness, smaller than that of the backscattering coefficients at low and high incidences alone. Under very wet soil conditions (for soil moistures between 32% and 41%), the radar signal decreases by about 4 dB. This decrease appears to be independent of incidence angle, and the ratio Delta sigma degrees is found to be independent of soil moisture. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We also assessed the potential application of lidar data for examining the relationship between habitat complexity and Hawaiian reef fish assemblage characteristics. Lidar-derived rugosity (4 m grid size) was found to be highly correlated with in-situ rugosity and was concluded to be a viable method for measuring rugosity in analogous coral reef environments. We established that lidar-derived rugosity was a good predictor of fish biomass and demonstrated a strong relationship with several fish assemblage metrics in hard bottom habitat at multiple spatial resolutions. This research demonstrates (i) the efficacy of lidar data to provide substrate rugosity measures at scales commensurate with the resources and their environment (ii) the applicability of lidar-derived rugosity for examining fish-habitat relationships on a coral reef in Hawaii and (iii) the potential of lidar to provide information about the seascape structure that can ultimately be used to prioritize areas for conservation and management.

Understanding ecosystem impacts of such disturbances requires knowledge of host species distribution patterns on the landscape. In this study, we mapped the distribution and abundance of host species for the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) to facilitate landscape scale planning and modeling of outbreak dynamics. We used multitemporal, multi-seasonal Landsat data and 128 ground truth plots (and 120 additional validation plots) to map basal area (BA), for 6.4 million hectares of forest in northern Minnesota and neighboring Ontario. Partial least-squares (PLS) regression was used to determine relationships between ground data and Landsat sensor data. Subsequently, BA was mapped for all forests, as well as for two specific host tree genera (Picea and Abies). These PLS regression analyses yielded estimates for overall forest BA with an R-2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 4.67 m(2) ha(-1) (20% of measured BA), white spruce relative BA with an R-2 of 0.88 (RMSE = 12.57 m(2) ha-(1) [20% of measured]), and balsam fir relative BA with an R-2 of 0.64 (RMSE=6.08 m(2) ha-(1) [33% of measured]). We also used this method to estimate the relative BA of deciduous and coniferous species, each with R-2 values of 0.86 and RMSE values of 9.89 m(2) ha(-1) (23% of measured) and 9.78 m(2) ha-1 (16% of measured), respectively. Of note, winter imagery (with snow cover) and shortwave infrared-based indices - especially the shortwave infrared/visible ratio - strengthened the models we developed. Because ground measurements were made largely in forest stands containing spruce and fir, modeled results are not applicable to stands dominated by non-target conifers such as pines and cedar. PLS regression has proven to be an effective modeling tool for regional characterization of forest structure within spatially heterogeneous forests using multi-temporal Landsat sensor data.

The thresholding technique is a common approach for settlement mapping based on the DMSP-OLS data. However, this approach often omits the areas with small proportional settlements such as towns and villages and overestimates urban extents, resulting in information loss of spatial patterns, This paper explored an integrated approach based on a combined use Of Multiple remotely sensed data to map settlements in southeastern China. Human settlements for selected sites were mapped from Landsat ETM+ images with a hybrid approach and they were used as reference data. The DMSP-OLS and Terra MODIS NDVI data were combined to develop a settlement index image. This index image was used to map a pixel-based settlement image with expert rules. A regression model was established to estimate fractional settlements at the regional scale, which the DMSP-OLS and MODIS NDVI data were used as independent variables and the settlement data derived from ETM+ images were used as a dependent variable. This research indicated that a combination of DMSP-OLS and NDVI variables provided a better estimation performance than single DMSP-OLS or NDVI variable, and the integrated approach for settlement mapping at the regional scale was promising. Compared to the results from the traditional thresholding technique, the estimated fractional settlement image in this paper greatly improved the spatial patterns of settlement distribution and accuracy of settlement areas. This paper provided a rapid and accurate approach to estimate fractional settlements from coarse spatial resolution images at the regional scale by combining a limited number of medium Spatial resolution images. This research is especially valuable for timely updating settlement databases at regional and global scales with limited time, labor, and cost. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Although the model is generic (only considering the physical transport), the results are of particular interest for sardine (Sardina pilchardus) early life stages, due to the spawning dynamics of the species off Iberia and NW Africa. Particles were released on the shelf of the Iberian and northern African Atlantic coasts every five days from 1998 to 2004 and advected for 27-days. Trajectories were computed using combinations of three surface velocity constituents: Ekman velocity, geostrophic velocity derived from sea level anomaly maps and mean geostrophic velocity derived from two mean dynamic topographies. Daily time series of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration and water depth where constructed for each particle trajectory. The results showed strong regional and seasonal dependence of the transport due to wind, with average seasonal cycles of the percentage of particles found in the shelf reflecting the anticipated effect of the seasonal north-south migration of the trade wind belt. The addition of the geostrophic transport led to the attenuation of seasonal cycles and higher mean/maximum values in the probability of retention within the shelf This increased capacity for retention even during strong upwelling conditions seems to have been overlooked by theories aiming to describe the reproductive strategies of pelagic fish and understand recruitment dynamics based primarily on wind variability. On the other hand, the average surface chlorophyll values indicated a distribution area with higher primary production for particles that never leave the shelf, in comparison to those that return to it or are found in the open sea a month after release, which is in agreement with existing hypotheses that offshore advection is detrimental to larval survival mainly due to the higher risk of starvation. Finally, the exchange between adjacent shelf areas was generally small (less than 5%) within the study period, with the exception of the Gulf of Cadiz. In the latter area, up to 50% of particles released in the southern Iberian shelf reached the Moroccan shelf in several events, contradicting previous suggestions that the Strait of Gibraltar acts as a physical barrier that promotes genetic differentiation among neighbouring sardine populations in the Atlantic. Overall, these results Provide useful insights for the study of sardine dynamics in the northeast Atlantic but the unexpectedly high sensitivity of summary metrics (namely retention probability) to the choice of surface velocity field preclude firm conclusions and indicate alternative routes for future studies.

In this paper, a hyperspectral remote sensing algorithm is developed to retrieve total leaf chlorophyll content for both open spruce and closed forests, and tested for open forest canopies. Ten black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.)) stands near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, were selected as study sites, where extensive field and laboratory measurements were carried out to collect forest structural parameters, needle and forest background optical properties, and needle biophysical parameters and biochemical contents chlorophyll a and b. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing imagery was acquired, within one week of ground measurements, by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) in a hyperspectral mode, with 72 bands and half bandwidth 4.25-4.36 nm in the visible and near-infrared region and a 2 m spatial resolution. The geometrical-optical model 4-Scale and the modified leaf optical model PROSPECT were combined to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from the CASI imagery. Forest canopy reflectance was first estimated with the measured leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra, forest background reflectance, CASI acquisition parameters, and a set of stand parameters as inputs to 4-Scale. The estimated canopy reflectance agrees well with the CASI measured reflectance in the chlorophyll absorption sensitive regions, with discrepancies of 0,06%-1.07% and 0.36%-1.63%, respectively, in the average reflectances of the red and red-edge region. A look-up-table approach was developed to provide the probabilities of viewing the sunlit foliage and background, and to determine a spectral multiple scattering factor as functions of leaf area index, view zenith angle, and solar zenith angle. With the look-up tables, the 4-Scale model was inverted to estimate leaf reflectance spectra from hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. Good agreements were obtained between the inverted and measured leaf reflectance spectra across the visible and near-infrared region, with R-2 =0.89 to R-2 = 0.97 and discrepancies of 0.02%-3.63% and 0.24%-7.88% in the average red and red-edge reflectances, respectively. Leaf chlorophyll content was estimated from the retrieved leaf reflectance spectra using the modified PROSPECT inversion model, with R-2 = 0.47, RMSE =4.34 mu g/cm(2), and jackknifed RMSE of 5.69 mu g/cm(2) for needle chlorophyll content ranging from 24.9 mu g/cm(2) to 37.6 mu g/cm(2). The estimates were also assessed at leaf and canopy scales using chlorophyll spectral indices TCARI/OSAVI and MTCI. An empirical relationship of simple ratio derived from the CASI imagery to the ground-measured leaf area index was developed (R-2=0.88) to map leaf area index. Canopy chlorophyll content per unit ground surface area was then estimated, based on the spatial distributions of leaf chlorophyll content per unit leaf area and the leaf area index.

[Im, J., Rhee, J., Jensen, J. R., & Hodgson, M. E. (2007). An automated binary change detection model using a calibration approach. Remote Sensing of Environment, 106, 89-105] developed an automated calibration model for optimizing the binary discriminant function by autonomously testing thousands of thresholds. However, the automated model may be time-consuming especially when multiple change-enhanced images are used as inputs together since the model is based on an exhaustive search technique. This paper describes the development of a computationally efficient search technique for identifying optimum threshold(s) in a remote sensing spectral search space. The new algorithm is based on \"systematic searching.\" Two additional heuristic optimization algorithms (i.e., hill climbing, simulated annealing) were examined for comparison. A case study using QuickBird and IKONOS satellite imagery was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed systematic search technique reduced the processing time required to identify the optimum binary discriminate function without decreasing accuracy. The other two optimizing search algorithms also reduced the processing time but failed to detect a global maxima for some spectral features.

Disturbance and early recovery were mapped using the temporal change in a Tasseled-Cap \"Disturbance Index\" calculated from the early (similar to 1990) and later (similar to 2000) images. Validation of the continental mapping has been carried out using a sample of biennial Landsat time series from 23 locations across the United States. Although a significant amount of disturbance (30-60%) cannot be mapped due to the long interval between image acquisition dates, the biennial analyses allow a first-order correction of the decadal mapping. Our results indicate disturbance rates of up to 2-3% per year are common across the US and Canada due primarily to harvest and forest fire. Rates are highest in the southeastern US, the Pacific Northwest, Maine, and Quebec. The mean disturbance rate for the conterminous United States (the \"lower 48\" states and District of Columbia) is calculated as 0.9 +/-0.2% per year, corresponding to a turnover period of 110 years.

A data base was generated from these products over the BELMANIP sites during the 2001-2003 period. Data were aggregated at 3 km x 3 km, resampled at 1/16 days temporal frequency and filtered to reject outliers. VEGETATION and MODIS reflectances show very consistent values in the red, near infrared and short wave infrared bands. Neural networks were trained over part of this data base for each of the 6 MODIS biome classes to retrieve both MODIS and CYCLOPES LAI products.   Results show very good performances of neural networks to estimate the original LAI products with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) around 0.5 for MODIS LAI from both MODIS and CYCLOPES normalized reflectances and a RMSE ranging between 0.12 (CYCLOPES reflectances) and 0.29 (MODIS reflectances) for CYCLOPES LAI. A drop of 15% of performance was found by training MODIS biome dependant algorithm by a single network over all the classes at the same time. More detailed analyses show that CYCLOPES and MODIS LAI values are very consistent for grasses and crops. Conversely, other biomes including shrubs, savanna, needleleaf and broadleaf forests show significant discrepancies, mainly due to differences between LAI definitions used between CYCLOPES (closer to effective LAI) and MODIS (closer to true LAI). However, products derived from the original CYCLOPES LAI products show a better agreement with both effective and true LAI ground measurements values. MODIS LAI products show more instability, partly because of the slightly shorter temporal resolution as compared to CYCLOPES.   These results confirm the interest and versatility of neural networks for operational algorithms. This approach could be extended to other products or sensors, and may constitute a step forward for the fusion of data from several sensors, hence contributing to develop \'virtual constellations\'.

With the development of geospatial information technology, including remote sensing, these models are now applied to an ever-increasing number of species, particularly those located in areas in which it is logistically difficult to collect habitat data in the field. Many habitat studies have used data acquired by multi-spectral sensor systems such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), due mostly to their availability and relatively high spatial resolution (30 m/pixel). The use of data collected by other sensor systems with lower spatial resolutions but high frequency of acquisitions has largely been neglected, due to the perception that such low spatial resolution data are too coarse for habitat mapping. In this study we compare two models using data from different satellite sensor systems for mapping the spatial distribution of giant panda habitat in Wolong Nature Reserve, China. The first one is a four-category scheme model based on combining forest cover (derived from a digital land cover classification of Landsat TM imagery acquired in June, 200 1) with information on elevation and slope (derived from a digital elevation model obtained from topographic maps of the study area). The second model is based on the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) of a time series of weekly composites of WDRVI (Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index) images derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - 250 m/pixel) for 2001. A series of field plots was established in the reserve during the summer-autumn months of 2001-2003. The locations of the plots with panda feces were used to calibrate the ENFA model and to validate the results of both models. Results showed that the model using the seasonal variability of MODIS-WDRVI had a similar prediction success to that using Landsat TM and digital elevation model data, albeit having a coarser spatial resolution. This suggests that the phenological characterization of the land surface provides an appropriate environmental predictor for giant panda habitat mapping. Therefore, the information contained in remotely sensed data acquired with low spatial resolution but high frequency of acquisitions has considerable potential for mapping the habitat distribution of wildlife species.

Spectral unmixing was used to determine the fractional composition of vegetation, open, and shadow for each pixel. Unsupervised and supervised classification techniques were then used to derive preliminary land cover snaps for each time period. Digital orthophotos were used to create agricultural, forest management, high elevation, and riparian masks. In conjunction with established Urban Growth Areas (UGAs), these masks were utilized for the application of spatial rules that identified impervious surface as a surrogate for urban and residential development. Temporal rules, that minimized classification error, were developed based on each pixel\'s classified trajectory over the time series of imagery. Overall cross-date classification accuracy for impervious v. non-impervious surface was 95%. The results of the analysis indicate that the area of impervious surface in the Snohomish WRIA increased by 255% over 34 years, from 3285 ha in 1972 to 11,652 ha in 2006. This approach demonstrates the unique value of the 35 year Landsat archive for monitoring impervious surface trends in rapidly urbanizing areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In addition these flagged zones migrate with season, and clearly follow the sun declination course. The combination of low chlorophyll waters with a residual sun-glint is at the origin of this artifact. Simple approaches for eliminating such a misleading detection are proposed.

Soil moisture can be especially variable in regions of complex terrain which exhibit large variations in vegetation, soil properties and hydrologic conditions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture in a mountainous basin in northwestern Mexico. Soil moisture estimates from ground sampling over a topographic transect and high resolution retrievals from the Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer are compared during a two week period in August 2004 as part of the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004. Results indicate that the soil moisture estimates exhibit similar variability with mean water content. Statistical analysis, however, reveals clear differences in soil moisture in the basin, in particular for wet periods and high elevations. Despite these differences, the temporal persistence of soil moisture from the estimates agrees well and indicates locations that capture the basin-averaged conditions. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal soil moisture characteristics from the two products are linked to terrain attributes. As a result, a hypsometric technique is shown to improve comparisons between basin-averaged values derived from ground data and remote sensing, as compared to arithmetic averaging. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to evaluate PSR/CX retrievals with respect to ground observations over a region of high topographic and vegetation variability using statistical, time-stability and terrain analysis techniques.

The sensitivity of active and passive microwave remote sensing data to surface soil moisture content has been investigated in numerous studies. Recent satellite home mission concepts, as e.g. the SMOS mission, are dedicated to provide global soil moisture information with a temporal frequency of 1-3 days to capture it\'s high temporal dynamics. Passive satellite microwave sensors have spatial resolutions in the order of tens of kilometres. The retrieved soil moisture fields from that sensors therefore represent surface information which is integrated over large areas. It has been shown that the heterogeneity within an image pixel might have considerable impact on the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals from passive microwave data.   The paper investigates the impact of land surface heterogeneity on soil moisture retrievals from L-band passive microwave data at different spatial scales between 1 km and 40 km. The impact of sensor noise and quality of ancillary information is explicitly considered. A synthetic study is conducted where brightness temperature observations are generated using simulated land surface conditions. Soil moisture information is retrieved from these simulated observations using an iterative approach based on multiangular observations of brightness temperature. The soil moisture retrieval uncertainties resulting from the heterogeneity within the image pixels as well as the uncertainties in the a priori knowledge of surface temperature data and due to sensor noise, is investigated at different spatial scales. The investigations are made for a heterogeneous hydrological catchment in Southern Germany (Upper Danube) which is dedicated to serve as a calibration and validation site for the SMOS mission.

We used such a high resolution to be able to parameterize DART in an appropriate way and subsequently to gain detailed understanding of the influence of woody elements contributing to the radiative transfer within heterogeneous canopies. Three scenarios were studied by modelling the Norway spruce canopy as being composed of i) leaves, ii) leaves, trunks and first order branches, and finally iii) leaves, trunks, first order branches and small woody twigs simulated using mixed cells (i.e. cells approximated as composition of leaves and/or twigs turbid medium, and large woody constituents). The simulation of each scenario was performed for 10 different canopy Closures (CC=50-95%, in steps of 5%), 25 leaf area index (LAI=3.0-15.0 m(2) m(-2), in steps of 0.5 m(2) m(-2)), and in four spectral bands (centred at 559, 671, 727, and 783 nm, with a FWHM of 10 nm). The influence of woody elements was evaluated separately for both, sunlit and shaded parts of the simulated forest canopy, respectively. The DART results were verified by quantifying the simulated nadir BRF of each scenario with measured Airborne Imaging Spectroradiorrieter (AISA) Eagle data (pixel size of 0.4 m). These imaging spectrometer data were acquired over the same Norway spruce stand that was used to parameterise the DART model.   The Norway spruce canopy modelled using the DART model consisted of foliage as well as foliage including robust woody constituents (i.e. trunks and branches). All results showed similar nadir BRF for the simulated wavelengths. The incorporation of small woody parts in DART caused the canopy reflectance to decrease about 4% in the near-infrared (NIR), 2% in the red edge (RE) and less than 1% in the green band. The canopy BRF of the red band increased by about 2%. Subsequently, the sensitivity on accounting for woody elements for two spectral vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the angular vegetation index (AVI), was evaluated. Finally, we conclude on the importance of including woody elements in radiative transfer based approaches and discuss the applicability of the vegetation indices as well as the physically based inversion approaches to retrieve the forest canopy LAI at very high spatial resolution.

As shown by Yoshioka et al., if the multiple soil/vegetation interactions are smaller than the first order ones then the fCover isolines can be approximated by straight lines in the (Red, Near Infrared) plane. Each isoline is completely defined by its slope alpha and its intersection point gamma (with the soil line), that have been related to fCover using SAIL simulations and optimization either by the Simplex (local optimization) or the SCE-UA (global optimization) algorithms. The results are compared to classical vegetation indices for both simulated and actual data. The method shows an improvement in most of cases. Moreover, when using the SCE-UA algorithm, our approach proves its robustness relative to high noise level. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The signal at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) was simulated using the 6S radiative transfer code that allows modeling of the adjacency effect for various types of sea ice surrounding an open water area. In situ sea ice reflectance spectra used in the simulations were measured prior to and during the melt period as part of the 2004 Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES). For sub-pixel contamination, the TOA signal was simulated for various surface reflectances obtained by linear mixture of both sea ice and water-leaving reflectances (rho(w)). The standard atmospheric correction algorithm was then applied to the simulated TOA spectra to retrieve rho(w) spectra from which chlorophyll a concentrations (CHL) and inherent optical properties (IOps) were derived. The adjacency effect was associated with large errors (> 0.002) in the retrieval of rho(w) as far as 24 km from an ice edge in the blue part of the spectrum (443 nm). Therefore, for moderate to high CHL (> 0.5 mg m(-3)), any pixel located within a distance of similar to 10-20 km from the ice edge were unreliable. It was also found necessary to consider the adjacency effect when the total absorption coefficient (a(t)) was to be retrieved using a semi-analytical algorithm. a(t)(443) was underestimated by more than 35% at a distance of 20 km from an ice edge for CHL > 0.5 mg m(-3). The effect on the retrieval of the particle backscattering coefficient (b(bp)) was important only for clear waters (CHL similar to 0.05 mg m(-3)). In contrast, sub-pixel contamination by a small amount of sea ice produced systematic underestimation of rho(w) in the blue because of incorrect interpretation of enhanced reflectance in the near infrared that is attributed to higher concentrations of atmospheric aerosols. In general, sub-pixel contamination was found to result in overestimations of CHL and at, and underestimations of bbp. A simple method was proposed to flag pixels contaminated by adjacency effect.

The added value of feature selection and neural network combination is investigated. Results show that, with GA-feature selection, the mean classification accuracy (in terms of Kappa Index of Agreement) is significantly higher (p<0.01) than without feature selection. On average, the summed output of 50 networks provided a significantly higher (p<0.01) classification accuracy than the mean output of 50 individual networks. Finally, the proposed classification routine yields a significantly higher (p<0.01) classification accuracy as compared with a strategy without feature selection and joint network output. In addition, the proposed method showed its potential when few training data were available. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The ocean is usually assumed to be black for open oceans at these two NIR bands with modifications for the productive waters and aerosols are assumed to be non- or weakly absorbing. For cases with strongly absorbing aerosols and cases with the significant NIR ocean contributions, the derived ocean color products will have significant errors, e.g., the derived MODIS normalized water-leaving radiances are biased low considerably. Both cases lead to a significant drop of the sensor-measured radiance at the short visible wavelengths, and they both have similar and indistinguishable radiance characteristics at the short visible wavelengths. To properly handle such cases, the strongly absorbing aerosols and turbid waters need to be identified. Therefore, an appropriate approach (different from the standard procedure) may be carried out. In this paper, we demonstrate methods to identify the turbid waters and strongly absorbing aerosols using combinations of MODIS-measured radiances at the short visible, NIR, and short wave infrared (SWIR) bands. The algorithms are based on the fact that for the turbid waters the ocean has significantly large contributions at the NIR bands, whereas at the SWIR bands the ocean is still black due to much stronger water absorption. With detection of the turbid waters, the strongly absorbing aerosols can then be identified using the MODIS measurements at the short visible and NIR bands. We provide results and discussions for test and evaluation of the algorithm performance with various examples in the coastal regions for the turbid waters and for various absorbing aerosols (e.g., volcano ash plumes, dust, smoke). The proposed algorithms are efficient in the data processing, and can be carried out prior to the atmospheric correction procedure. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These have usually considered tree stock as a whole, even though it is tree species-specific forest information that is of primary interest in Finland, for example. We will therefore concentrate here on prediction of the species-specific forest variables volume, stem number, basal area, basal area median diameter and tree height, applying the non-parametric k-MSN method to a combination of ALS data and aerial photographs in order to predict these stand attributes simultaneously for Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous trees as well as total characteristics as sums of the species-specific estimates. The predictor variables derived from the ALS data were based on the height distribution of vegetation hits, whereas spectral values and texture features were employed in the case of the aerial photographs. The data covered 463 sample plots in 67 stands in eastern Finland, and the results showed that this approach can be used to predict species-specific forest variables at least as accurately as from the current stand-level field inventory for Finland. The characteristics of Scots pine and Norway spruce were predicted more accurately than those of deciduous trees. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

For example, between 1977 and 1999, the average area surveyed each year on the field was 6.8 km(2) only. No direct mass balance measurement is available after 1999. To contribute to fill this gap, we use remote sensing data to monitor glacier elevation changes and mass balances in the Spiti/Lahaul region (32.2 degrees N, 77.6 degrees E, Himachal Pradesh, Western Himalaya, India). Our measurements are obtained by comparing a 2004 digital elevation model (DEM) to the 2000 SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) topography.   The 2004 DEM is derived from two SPOT5 satellite optical images without any ground control points. This is achieved thanks to the good onboard geolocation of SPOT5 scenes and using SRTM elevations as a reference on the ice free zones. Before comparison on glaciers, the two DEMs are analyzed on the stable areas surrounding the glaciers where no elevation change is expected. Two different biases are detected. A long wavelength bias affects the SPOT5 DEM and is correlated to an anomaly in the roll of the SPOT5 satellite. A bias is also observed as a function of altitude and is attributed to the SRTM dataset. Both biases are modeled and removed to permit unbiased comparison of the two DEM on the 915 km(2) ice-covered area digitized from an ASTER image.   On most glaciers, a clear thinning is measured at low elevations, even on debris-covered tongues. Between 1999 and 2004, we obtain an overall specific mass balance of -0.7 to -0.85 m/a (water equivalent) depending on the density we use for the lost (or gained) material in the accumulation zone. This rate of ice loss is twice higher than the long-term (1977 to 1999) mass balance record for Himalaya indicating an increase in the pace of glacier wastage. To assess whether these ice losses are size-dependant, all glaciers were classified into three samples according to 2 their areal extent. All three samples show ice loss, the loss being higher for glaciers larger than 30 kin. In the case of the benchmark Chhota Shigri glacier, a good agreement is found between our satellite observations and the mass balances measured on the field during hydrological years 2002-2003 and 2003-2004. Future studies using a similar methodology could determine whether similar ice losses have occurred in other parts of the Himalaya and may allow evaluation of the contribution of this mountain range to ongoing sea level rise.

The MODIS cloud mask is used as the initial classification. The results are analyzed with the help of true color and RGB composite images as well as other information about surface and cloud types. Results indicate that the future sensors (ABI and VIIRS) provide much better overall cloud classification capabilities than their corresponding current sensors (the current GOES-12 Imager and AVHRR/3) from the two chosen demonstration cases. However, for a specific class, it is not always true that more spectral bands result in better classification. In order to optimally use the spectral information, it is necessary to determine which bands are more sensitive for a specific class. Spatial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of satellite sensors can significantly affect the classification. The 2.13 mu m band could be useful for thin low cloud detection and the 3.7 mu m band is useful for fresh snow detection. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The present paperdescribes such a package based on the 3 and 4 parameter versions of the RPV model. This software environment implements the adjoint code, generated using automatic differentiation techniques, of the cost function. This cost function itself balances two main contributions reflecting 1) the a priori knowledge on the model parameter values and, 2) BRF uncertainties together with the requirement to minimize the mismatch between the measurements and the RPV simulations. The individual weights of these contributions is specified notably via covariance matrices of the uncertainties in the a priori knowledge on the model parameters and the observations. This package also reports on the probability density functions of the retrieved model parameter values that thus permit the user to evaluate the a posteriori uncertainties on these retrievals. This is achieved by evaluating the Hessian of the cost function at its minimum. Results from a variety of tests are shown in order to document and analyze software performance against complex synthetic BRF fields simulated by radiation transfer models as well as against actual MISR-derived surface BRF products.

The present study explores the benefits of combining vegetation index and physically based approaches for the spatial and temporal mapping of green leaf area index (LAI), total chlorophyll content (TCab), and total vegetation water content (VWC). A numerical optimization method was employed for the inversion of a canopy reflectance model using Terra and Aqua MODIS multi-spectral, multi-temporal, and multi-angle reflectance observations to aid the determination of vegetation-specific physiological and structural canopy parameters. Land cover and site-specific inversion modeling was applied to a restricted number of pixels to build multiple species- and environmentally dependent formulations relating the three biophysical properties of interest to a number of selected simpler spectral vegetation indices (VI). While inversions generally are computationally slow, the coupling with the simple and computationally efficient VI approach makes the combined retrieval scheme for LAI, TCab, and VWC suitable for large-scale mapping operations. In order to facilitate application of the canopy reflectance model to heterogeneous forested areas, a simple correction scheme was elaborated, which was found to improve forest LAI predictions significantly and also provided more realistic values of leaf chlorophyll contents.   The inversion scheme was designed to enable biophysical parameter retrievals for land cover classes characterized by contrasting canopy architectures, leaf inclination angles, and leaf biochemical constituents without utilizing calibration measurements. Preliminary LAI validation results for the Island of Zealand, Denmark (57 degrees N, 12 degrees E) provided confidence in the approach with root mean square (RMS) deviations between estimates and in-situ measurements of 0.62, 0.46, and 0.63 for barley, wheat, and deciduous forest sites, respectively. Despite the independence on site-specific in-situ measurements, the RMS deviations of the automated approach are in the same range as those established in other studies employing field-based empirical calibration.   Being completely automated and image-based and independent on extensive and impractical surface measurements, the retrieval scheme has potential for operational use and can quite easily be implemented for other regions. More validation studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness and limitations of the approach for other environments and species compositions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The urban heat island phenomenon results from the replacement of natural landscapes with impervious surfaces such as concrete and asphalt and is linked to adverse economic and environmental impacts. In order to better understand the urban microclimate, a greater assessment of the overall urban thermal pattern, including an analysis of the thermal properties of individual land covers, is needed. This study examines the surface thermal pattern by means of thermal land cover response for the Salt Lake City, Utah, study area at two scales: 1) the community level, and 2) the regional or valleywide level. Airborne ATLAS (Advanced Thermal and Land Applications Sensor) data, a high spatial resolution (10-meter) dataset appropriate for an environment containing a concentration of diverse land covers, are used for both land cover and thermal analysis at the community level. The ATLAS data consist of 15 channels covering the visible, near-IR, mid-IR and thermal-IR wavelengths. At the regional level Landsat TM data are used for land cover analysis while the ATLAS channel 13 data are used for the thermal analysis.   Results show that a ground-level heat island is evident at both the community and the valleywide level where there is an abundance of impervious surfaces. ATLAS data perform well in community level studies in terms of land cover and thermal exchanges, but other, more coarse-resolution data sets are more appropriate for large-area thermal studies. Thermal response per land cover is consistent at both levels, which suggests potential for comparison with more coarse spatial resolution studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Observations of urban reflectance and surface temperature provide valuable constraints on the physical properties that are determinants of mass and energy fluxes in the urban environment. Consistencies in the covariation of surface temperature with reflectance properties can be parameterized to represent characteristics of the surface energy flux associated with different land covers and physical conditions. Linear mixture models can accurately represent Landsat ETM+ reflectances as fractions of generic spectral endmembers that correspond to land surface materials with distinct physical properties. Modeling heterogeneous land cover as mixtures of rock and/or soil Substrate, Vegetation and non-reflective Dark surface (SVD) generic endmembers makes it possible to quantify the dependence of aggregate surface temperature on the relative abundance of each physical component of the land cover, thereby distinguishing the effects of vegetation abundance, soil exposure, albedo and shadowing. Comparing these covariations in a wide variety of urban settings and physical environments provides a more robust indication of the global variability in these parameter spaces than could be inferred from a single study area. A comparative analysis of 24 urban areas and their non-urban peripheries illustrates the variability in the urban thermal fields and its dependence on biophysical land surface components. Contrary to expectation, moderate resolution intra-urban variations in surface temperature are generally as large as regional surface heat island signatures in these urban areas. Many of the non-temperate urban areas did Dot have surface heat island signatures at all. However, the multivariate distributions of surface temperature and generic endmember fractions reveal consistent patterns of thermal fraction covariation resulting from land cover characteristics. The Thermal-Vegetation (TV) fraction space illustrates the considerable variability in the well-known inverse correlation between surface temperature and vegetation fraction at moderate (< 100 m) spatial resolutions. The Thermal-Substrate (TS) fraction space reveals energetic thresholds where competing effects of albedo, illumination and soil moisture determine the covariation of maximum and minimum temperature with illuminated substrate fraction. The dark surface endmember fraction represents a fundamental ambiguity in the radiance signal because it can correspond to either absorptive (e.g. low albedo asphalt), transmissive (e.g. deep clear water) or shadowed (e.g. tree canopy shadow) surfaces. However, in areas where dark surface composition can be inferred from spatial context, the different responses of these surfaces may still allow them to be distinguished in the thermal fraction space.

The present study aims at effective monitoring of forest fires over the Indian region using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime satellite data and to evaluate the active fire detection capabilities of the sensor. Nightly DMSP-OLS fire products were generated from February to May 2005 (peak fire season) and analyzed to study the occurrence and behavior of fires over different forest physiognomies in Indian region. Fire products generated from DMSP-OLS were validated with ground observations of fire records from state forest departments to evaluate the accuracy of fire products. Further, inter-comparison of the DMSP-OLS derived fire products with contemporary fire products from Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (both daytime and nighttime products) in addition to fires and burnt areas derived from Indian Remote sensing Satellite (IRS-P6) Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data has been done to analyze spatial agreement of fire locations given by the above sensors.   Results from the DMSP-OLS fire products (derived from February to May 2005) over Indian region showed high forest fires in southern dry deciduous forests during February-March; central Indian dry and mixed deciduous forests during March-April; northeastern tropical forests during February-April and northern pine forests during May. Spatial pattern in fires showed a typical seasonal shift in fire activity from the southern dry deciduous forests to the northern pine forests and temperate forests as the fire season progressed. Statistical evaluation of DMSP-OLS fire products with ground observations showed an over all accuracy of 98%. Comparison of DMSP-OLS derived fires with consecutive MODIS and AWiFS derived fires for individual days indicated that 69% of the fires continued from current day (DMSP-OLS pass around similar to 7pm to similar to 10pm local time) to the next day (MODIS and AWiFS pass similar to 10:30am local time). Comparison of DMSP-OLS derived fires with burnt areas estimated from AWiFS showed that 98% of DMSP-OLS derived fires on the current day fell within the burnt area of AWiFS on subsequent day. Since the worst forest fires are those that extend from the current to the consecutive days, DMSP-OLS derived fires provide a valuable augmentation to the fires derived from other sensors operating in daytime.

Tree cover and height are important variables to characterize this vegetation transition. Accurate continuous fields of tree cover and height would enable the delineation of the forest extent according to different criterion and provide useful data for change detection of this climatically sensitive ecotone. This study examined if multiangular remote sensing data has potential to improve the accuracy of the tree cover and height estimates in relation to nadir-view data. The satellite data consisted of Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data at 275 m and 1.1 km resolutions. The study area was located in the Fennoscandian tundra-taiga transition zone, in northernmost Finland. The continuous fields of tree cover and height were estimated using neural networks, which were trained and assessed by high-resolution biotope inventory data. The spectral-angular data together produced lower estimation errors than single band nadir, multispectral nadir or single band multiangular data alone. RMSE of the tree cover estimates reduced from 7.8% (relative RMSE 67.4%) to 6.5% (56.1%) at 275 m resolution, and from 5.4% (49.2%) to 4.1% (36.9%) at 1.1 km resolution, when multispectral nadir data were used together with multiangular data. RMSE of the tree height estimates reduced from 2.3 m (44.3%) to 2.0 m (37.6%) and from 1.8 m (35.4%) to 1.3 m (25.4%), respectively. The largest estimation errors occurred in mires and in areas of dense shrub cover, but the use of multiangular data also reduced estimation errors in these areas. The results suggest that directional information has potential to improve the tree cover and height estimates, and hence the accuracy of the land cover change detection in the tundra-taiga transition zone.

The spatial-temporal dynamics of oak mortality at the landscape scale are crucial indicators of disease progression. Modeling disease spread requires accurate mapping of the dynamic pattern of oak mortality in time through multi-temporal image analysis. Traditional mapping approaches using per-pixel, single-date image classifications have not generated consistently satisfactory results. Incorporation of spatial-temporal contextual information can improve these results. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporally explicit algorithm to classify individual images using the spectral and spatial-temporal information derived from multiple co-registered images. This algorithm is initialized by a spectral classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for each individual image, Then, a Markov Random Fields (MRF) model accounting for ecological compatibility is used to model the spatial-temporal contextual prior probabilities of images. Finally, an iterative algorithm, Iterative Conditional Mode (ICM), is used to update the classification based on the combination of the initial SVM spectral classifications and MRF spatial-temporal contextual model. The algorithm was applied to two-year (2000, 2001) ADAR (Airborne Data Acquisition and Registration) images, from which three classes (bare, dead, forest) are detected. The results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved significantly better results (Year 2000: Kappa=0.92; Year 2001: Kappa=0.91), compared to traditional pixel-based single-date approaches (Year 2000: Kappa=0.67; Year 2001: Kappa=0.66). The improvement from the contributions of spatial-temporal contextual information indicated the importance of spatial-temporal modeling in multi-temporal remote sensing in general and forest disease modeling in particular.

At present, this is mostly achieved through ground study. This paper presents a method based on the satellite image time series, which can save time and money and greatly speed the process of urban forest carbon storage mapping, and possibly of regional forest mapping. Satellite imagery collected in different decades was used to develop a regression equation to predict the urban forest carbon storage from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) computed from a time sequence (1985-1999) of Landsat image data. This regression was developed from the 1999 field-based model estimates of carbon storage in Syracuse, NY. The total carbon storage estimates based on the NDVI data agree closely with the field-based model estimates. Changes in total carbon storage by trees in Syracuse were estimated using the image data from 1985, 1992, and 1999. Radiometric correction was accomplished by normalizing the imagery to the 1999 image data. After the radiometric image correction, the carbon storage by urban trees in Syracuse was estimated to be 146,800 tons, 149,430 tons, and 148,660 tons of carbon for 1985, 1992, and 1999, respectively. The results demonstrate the rapid and cost-effective capability of remote sensing-based quantitative change detection in monitoring the carbon storage change and the impact of urban forest management over wide areas.

Knowledge of the variability of microwave signatures of vegetation and soil roughness is necessary to separate these influences from those of soil moisture for remote sensing applications to global hydrology and climate. We describe here a characterization of vegetation and soil roughness at the frequencies and spatial resolution of the EOS Aqua Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). A single parameter has been used to approximate the combined effects of vegetation and roughness. AMSR-E data have been analyzed to determine the frequency dependence of this parameter and to generate a global vegetation/roughness map and an estimate of seasonal variability. A physical model is used for the analysis with approximations appropriate to the AMSR-E footprint scale and coefficients calibrated empirically against the AMSR-E data. The spatial variabilities of roughness and vegetation cannot be estimated independently using this approach, but their temporal dynamics allow separation of predominantly static roughness effects from time-varying vegetation effects using multitemporal analysis. Global signals of time-varying vegetation water content derived from this analysis of AMSR-E data are consistent with time-varying biomass estimates obtained by optical/infrared remote sensing techniques.

The first step of the method consisted in an unsupervised classification of a large set of clear-sky top of the atmosphere reflectance spectra measured by the sensor. We used the so-called Kohonen map which aggregates similar spectra into a reduced set of pertinent groups. The second step consisted in labeling these groups by clustering them with synthetic TOA reflectance spectra whose optical properties (i.e., aerosol type or optical thickness) are known. These synthetic spectra have been computed using a radiative transfer model. In the present study, we dealt with five aerosol types (maritime, coastal, tropospheric, oceanic and mineral) and several aerosol optical thickness values ranging from 0.05 to 0.8. These simulated spectra were then projected onto the Kohonen map to label each group of the map. The last step consisted in applying this method to the SeaWiFS imagery of the Mediterranean region for the years 1999 and 2000. The Kohonen map was \"educated\" from pixels randomly extracted during the year 1999 in this region. We accounted for the viewing geometry of the sensor by clustering the simulated spectra into ten groups of similar geometries, as defined by both scattering and sun zenith angles. The analysis of SeaWiFS images was performed pixel-by-pixel by selecting the suitable labeling (in terms of viewing geometry), then by identifying the closest spectrum in the Kohonen map, which finally gives the aerosol optical properties. This method led to accurate and coherent results, as shown by the comparison with in situ aerosol measurements provided by the AERONET station at Lampedusa and by the study of two aerosol events over the Mediterranean. One of the major advantages of this method is that it enables us to automatically identify the aerosol type and to retrieve the aerosol optical properties with a better accuracy than classical methods such as those used by SeaWifs. It gives accurate results for optical thickness values larger than 0.35 and is able to retrieve dust aerosols such as African dust aerosol (absorbing aerosol). These should ensure a more precise inversion of ocean-color imagery where the knowledge of atmospheric optical parameters is essential. Moreover the method is able to give probabilities for the estimate values of aerosol properties. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Univ Paris 06, LOCEAN, IPSL, F-75252 Paris, France.

One way of documenting this change is by recognizing and characterizing the different plant colonization stages and trends that occur on these relatively new environments. Previous studies have shown that remotely sensed data alone are not sufficient to map the vegetation over these types of landscapes because the most significant part of the radiometric information is related to mineral landscape components. Therefore, the authors used an indirect approach which consisted in the following steps.   1. An optimized sampling procedure was used to collect georeferenced vegetation plot data. A multivariate analysis was then used to define vegetation types that could be related to different colonization stages and environmental contexts.   2. Color infrared aerial photographs were then used to produce a baseline vegetation map. This map was then integrated into a data base along with other environment factors known to control,plant colonization processes, such as climate (wind, temperature), physical landscape components (habitat characteristics) and morphodynamic processes (runoff).   3. A Bayesian model using conditional probabilities was used to identify the primary environmental habitats corresponding to the different vegetation types.   This protocol was tested on the fore field of the Midre Lovenbreen (Svalbard) glacier where several vegetation belts correspond to well defined stages of deglaciation and corresponding local conditions such as microtopography, microclimate and runoff dynamics.

FAPAR(canopy) is an important biophysical variable and has been used to estimate gross and net primary production. However, only PAR absorbed by chlorophyll is used for photosynthesis, and therefore there is a need to quantify FAPAR(chl). We modified and coupled a leaf radiative transfer model (PROSPECT) and a canopy radiative transfer model (SAIL-2), and incorporated a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (the Metropolis algorithm) for model inversion, which provides probability distributions of the retrieved variables. Our two-step procedure is: (1) to retrieve biophysical and biochemical variables using coupled PROSPECT+SAIL-2 model (PROSAIL-2), combined with multiple daily images (five spectral bands) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor; and (2) to calculate FAPAR(canopy), FAPAR(leaf) and FAPAR(chl) with the estimated model variables frorn the first step. We evaluated our approach for a temperate forest area in the Northeastern US, using MODIS data from 2001 to 2003. The inverted PROSAIL-2 fit the observed MODIS reflectance data well for the five MODIS spectral bands. The estimated leaf area index (LAI) values are within the range of field measured data. Significant differences between FAPAR(canopy) and FAPAR(chl) are found for this test case. Our study demonstrates the potential for using a model such as PROSAIL-2, combined with an inverse approach, for quantifying FAPAR(chl), FAPAR(leaf), FAPAR(canopy), biophysical variables, and biochemical variables for deciduous broadleaf forests at leaf- and canopy-levels over time.

ASTER ratio images, matched-filter, and spectral-angle mapper processing (SAM) were evaluated for mapping the lithologies. Matched-filter processing in which VNIR+SNVIR image spectra were used for reference resulted in 4 felsic classes and 4 mafic-ultramafic classes based on Al-OH or Fc.Mg-OH absorption features and, in some, subtle reflectance differences related to differential weathering and vegetation.

Utilization of the complementary attributes of the spectral reflectance and spectral emittance data resulted in discrimination of 4 mafic-ultramafic categories; 3 categories of alluvial-colluvial deposits; and a significantly more completely mapped quartzite unit than could be accomplished by using either data set alone.

Typically, a zero value is assumed or a threshold value is derived from histogram analysis of imagery to determine the shadow endmember (EM). Here, two distinct shadow EMs were measured in situ for use in spectral mixture analysis of a cotton canopy on five dates in 2003. The four EMs used in the analysis were: sunlit green leaf, sunlit dry soil, self-shadowed leaf, shadowed dry soil. This 4-EM model was compared to a 3-EM model where a zero-value shade EM was used for unmixing with the two sunlit EMs. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) was used to allow EM composition to vary across each scene. The analysis and EMs were applied to fine-scale hyperspectral image data collected in the wavelength range, 440 to 8 10 nm. Ground data collected included percent cover, height, SPAD (a measure of leaf greenness), and chlorophyll a concentration. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was also compared to the unmixing results. Regression analysis showed that NDVI was equal to the 4-EM model for estimation of percent cover (r(2) = 0.95, RMSE = 6.6) although the NDVI y-intercept was closer to zero. The 4-EM model was best for estimating height (r(2) = 0.79, PMSE=0.07 in) and chlorophyll a concentration (r(2) = 0.46, RMSE=7.0 mu g/cm(2)). The 3-EM model and NDVI per-formed poorly when estimating chlorophyll a concentration. Inclusion of two distinct shadow EMs in the model improved relationships to crop biophysical parameters and was better than assuming one, zero-value shade EM. Since MESMA operates at the pixel level and allows variable EM assignment to each pixel, mapping the spatial variability of shadows and other variables of interest is possible, providing a powerful input to canopy and ecosystem models as well as precision fanning.

Experimental campaigns were held in the summers of 2002-2004, when rice crops show full vegetation cover. LSTs were measured radiometrically along transects covering an area of 1 km(2). A total number of four thermal radiometers were used, which were calibrated and inter-compared through the campaigns. Radiometric temperatures were corrected for emissivity effects using field emissivity and downwelling sky radiance measurements. A database of ground-based LSTs corresponding to morning, cloud-free overpasses of Envisat/ Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is presented. Ground LSTs ranged from 25 to 32 degrees C, with uncertainties between +/-0.5 and +/-0.9 degrees C. The largest part of these uncertainties was due to the spatial variability of surface temperature. The database was used for the validation of LSTs derived from the operational AATSR and MODIS split-window algorithms, which are currently used to generate the LST product in the L2 level data. A quadratic, emissivity dependent split-window equation applicable to both AATSR and MODIS data was checked as well. Although the number of cases analyzed is limited (five concurrences for AATSR and eleven for MODIS), it can be concluded that the split-window algorithms work well, provided that the characteristics of the area are adequately prescribed, either through the classification of the land cover type and the vegetation cover, or with the surface emissivity. In this case, the AATSR LSTs yielded an average error or bias of - 0.9 degrees C (ground minus algorithm), with a standard deviation of 0.9 degrees C. The MODIS LST product agreed well with the ground LSTs, with differences comparable or smaller than the uncertainties of the ground measurements for most of the days (bias of +0.1 degrees C and standard deviation of 0.6 degrees C, for cloud-free cases and viewing angles smaller than 60 degrees).

The claimed connection of TIR emission with seismic activity has been considered, up to now, with some caution by the scientific community mainly for the insufficiency of the validation data-sets and the scarce importance attached by those authors to other causes (e.g. meteorological) that, rather than seismic activity, could be responsible for the observed TIR signal fluctuations.   In this paper, a robust satellite data analysis technique is described which pen-nits us to identify anomalous space-time TIR signal transients even in very variable observational (satellite view angle, land topography and coverage, etc.) and natural (e.g. meteorological) conditions. A statistically well-founded definition of TIR anomaly is given and proposed as a suitable tool for satellite TIR surveys in seismically active regions. Eight years of Meteosat TIR observations have been analyzed in order to characterize the TIR signal behavior at each specific observation time and location. Space-time TIR signal transients have then been analyzed, both in the presence (validation) and in the absence of (confutation) seismic events, looking for possible space-time relationships. The devastating earthquake which occurred in Turkey (Izmit.. August 17, M-S similar to 7.8) in 1999 has been considered as a test case for validation, relatively unperturbed periods (no earthquakes with M > 5) were taken for confutation purposes. Quite intense (S/N > 3.5) and rare, spatially extensive and time persistent, TIR signal transients were identified appearing eight days before the Izmit main shock in Greece, moving to Turkey on August 13 and disappearing, moving back to Greece, some days after. Possible implications of such results, together with present limitations of the proposed technique, will also be discussed in the light of the improved performances expected by its extension to other existing or future satellite packages.

Although AGB is an important variable for evaluating ecosystem function and structure across the landscape, such estimates are difficult to generate without high-resolution satellite data. This study bridges the application of remote sensing techniques with various forest management practices in Chequamegon National Forest (CNF), Wisconsin, USA by producing a high-resolution stand age map and a spatially explicit AGB map. We coupled AGB values, calculated from field measurements of tree dbh, with various vegetation indices derived from Landsat 7 ETM+ data through multiple regression analyses to produce an initial biomass map. The initial biomass map was overlaid with a land-cover map to generate a stand age map. Biomass threshold values for each age category (e.g., young, intermediate, and mature) were determined through field observations and frequency analysis of initial biomass estimates by major cover types. We found that AGB estimates for hardwood forests were strongly related to stand age and near-infrared reflectance (r(2)=0.95) while the AGB for pine forests was strongly related to the corrected normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIc; r(2)=0.86). Separating hardwoods from pine forests improved the AGB estimates in the area substantially, compared to overall regression (r(2)=0.82). Our AGB results are comparable to previously reported values in the area. The total amount of AGB in the study area for 2001 was estimated as 3.3 million metric tons (dry weight), 76.5% of which was in hardwood and mixed hardwood/pine forests. AGB ranged from 1 to 358 Mg/ha with an average of 70 and a standard deviation of 54 Mg/ha. The AGB class with the highest percentage (16.1%) was between 81 and 100 Mg/ha. Forests with biomass values >200 Mg/ha accounted for less than 3% of the study area and were usually associated with mature hardwood forests. Estimated AGB was validated using independent field measurements (R-2=0.67, p<0.001). The AGB and age maps can be used as baseline information for future landscape level studies such as quantifying the regional carbon budget, accumulating fuel, or monitoring management practices.

This earthquake, of moment magnitude (Mw) 6.6, occurred at 01:56:52 (UTC) on December 26, 2003 near the towns of Bam and Baravat. An active fault that ruptured during the earthquake can be seen on three-dimensional (3D) pre- and post-earthquake images generated from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) visible and near infrared (VNIR) data. The interpretation and analysis of satellite images suggest that a dextral fault extends for 65 km through the Bam-Baravat region. It strikes north-northwest and steps leftward at a segment boundary between two towns. Transpressional stress at this step-over (bend) probably triggered the 2003 earthquake rupture, as suggested also by source mechanism solution of the Bam earthquake and by landforms observed in the field. In the past 2000 years, Bam has had no earthquake as destructive as the one in 2003. The potential for this catastrophe could have been identified through a combination of satellite remote sensing technique and field reconnaissance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

These sites provide a globally distributed network of sites where field, aircraft, and satellite data are being collected. As much as possible, uniform data sets useful for validation are being made available for the core sites. The globally consistent, high-resolution imagery available from IKONOS are being used for their geolocation accuracy and ability to characterize the landscape at the 1- to 4-m spatial resolution. This paper provides an overview of the MODIS Land Team\'s validation strategy to incorporate high-resolution imagery and presents three case studies as examples of the use of IKONOS data for MODIS land validation activities.

While most of the region remains forested, rapid development has led, over the past two decades, to the destruction of over 589,000 km(2) of forests in Brazil alone. Forest clearing can alter the transport of sediments, organic matter and associated nutrients to the rivers. In this article, we present the results of an integrated analysis of the landscape characteristics, including soil properties, river network, topography, and land use/cover of a tropical meso-scale river. This physical template was developed as a comprehensive tool, based on Remote Sensing and GIS, to support the understanding of the biogeochemistry of surface waters of the Ji-Parana river basin, State of Rondonia, Western Amazonia. Our primary objective was to demonstrate how this tool can help the understanding of complex environmental questions, such as the effects of land-use changes in the biogeochemistry of riverine systems. River sites and basin characteristics were calculated using the data sets compiled as layers in Arc-Info GIS. A land-use/cover map for 1999 was produced from a digital classification of Landsat 7-ETM+ images. To test the effects of the landscape characteristics on river water chemistry, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis. Average slope, river network density, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), and proportion of pasture were treated as independent variables. River water electrical conductivity (EC) and Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl- and PO43- concentrations were the dependent variables. Spatially, higher values of all ions were associated with areas dominated by pasture, with the highest concentrations found in the central part of the basin, where pasture areas are at a maximum. As the river enters the lower reaches, forests dominate the landscape, and the concentrations drop. The percentage of the basin area covered by pasture was consistently the best predictor of EC (r(2) = 0.872), PO43- (r(2) = 0.794), Na+ (r(2) =0.754), Cl- (r(2) = 0.692) and K+ (r(2) = 0.626). For Ca2+, both ECEC (r(2) = 0.538) and pasture (r(2) = 0.502) explained most of the observed variability. The same pattern was found for Mg2+ (r(2) = 0.498 and 0.502, respectively).

These were correlated against soil fertility parameters such as phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and base saturation. In temporal analysis, it was observed that NPV dominated the spectral responses of pasture canopies and tended to increase with pasture age as well. The increase of NPV appeared to be related to the decline of soil fertility, but soil texture variation also played a role. In the correlation analysis, soil P, known as the most limiting nutrient for pasture productivity, showed the highest correlation with remotely sensed measures, followed by soil K and base saturation.

The late-August MASTER images reveal a distinct pattern of snow contaminant content, grain size, and temperature related to a recent snowfall and late-summer melting. Spatial correlation between grain size and temperature patterns suggests that rapid destructive metamorphism of the fresh snow occurred when temperatures were near 0 degreesC. We use 10 specific locations to evaluate hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF), grain size, and temperature retrievals. We map relative snow contaminant content using visible (0.4-0.8 gm) HDRF spectra. Atmospheric correction and topographic modeling limit the accuracy of HDRF estimates. We use MASTER-derived spectra near 1.8 and 2.2 mum to estimate optical grain size (by comparison to modeled layers of ice spheres) and physical grain size (by comparison to measured spectra with known physical grain size and by correlation to ground measurements). Estimated physical grain sizes were less than estimated optical grain sizes. Differing definitions of optical and physical grain sizes could contribute to this discrepancy. Limitations at 1.8 and 2.2 mum, including reduced discrimination between larger grain radii (> similar to 500 mum physical, > similar to 200 mum optical) and low signal-to-noise ration with atmospheric effects and decreasing solar irradiance, suggest that grain size retrieval may be improved at other wavelengths (e.g., 1.1 mum). Accounting for uncertainty in emissivity, atmospheric correction, and detector noise, we estimate systematic errors in our radiant temperatures at < 1.8 degreesC.

The data set enabled (a) the study of stem volume retrieval performance under vaning conditions, (b) the analysis of the seasonal behavior of interferometric coherence, and (c) the determination of the accuracy characteristics of empirical (nonlinear) coherence modeling. Additionally, a new technique to estimate forest stem volume from WSAR data was developed based on constrained iterative inversion of the applied empirical model. The results indicate that the usability of winter images with snow-covered terrain is superior to that of images obtained under summer conditions. The applied empirical model appears to be adequate for describing the stand-wise coherence of boreal forest. Hence, a practical stem volume estimation method can be established based on it. The highest correlation coefficient between the estimated stem volume and the ground truth stem volume showed values as high as r = 0.9 and a relative RMSE level of 48% was obtained, respectively.

However, the majority of SAR studies of forest dynamics use only imagery acquired by one SAR system and are thus limited to the lifecycle of a particular satellite. The synergistic analysis of SAR data from one of the earliest spaceborne SAR missions, the SEASAT mission, with the Japanese JERS-1 satellite-borne SAR is presented. Biophysical parameters frequently retrieved from SAR are tree biomass using backscatter and tree height from the interferometric phase. One potential application that has not been thoroughly examined is mapping of incremental tree growth from SAR backscatter changes. Tree growth measures biomass changes over time, and is correlated to the amount of carbon sequestered by the trees. This paper examines the retrieval of tree growth from multitemporal spaceborne L-band SAR. A SEASAT SAR image from 1978 and a JERS-1 SAR image from 1997 over Thetford forest, UK are used to retrieve tree growth of Corsican Pine stands. Incremental growth was estimated from the changes in backscatter coefficient, and compared to the expected tree growth from general yield class models used by the UK Forestry Commission. The accuracy of the retrieval algorithm depends on the minimum forest stand size included in the analysis. For managed forest plantations, multitemporal L-band SAR has some potential for detecting incremental biomass to support sustainable forest management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

EOF statistics demonstrated the features of an El Nino event during the second half of 1997 and the first half of 1998, with sea level elevated along the coast and with SSHA gradients, indicating a retarding of both the equatorward California Current and the alongshore poleward Southern California Countercurrent. The positive SST anomaly developed first in the Southern California Bight and then in the zone of upwelling to the north of Point Conception. The anomalies of upwelling index and the wind stress curl pattern also changed during the El Nino event, but these changes occurred later than hydrographic variations and were too weak to explain the observed changes in SSTA and SSRA. We conclude that off central and southern California oceanic teleconnection (i.e., the consequences of propagation northward of coastally trapped downwelling waves) was responsible for the 1997-1998 El Nino event.

Between October and February, the MCSST data were a reliable source of SSTs north of 60degreesS, but their quality (i.e. spatial and temporal density) was degraded severely at higher latitudes. Between April and August, the interpolated MCSST data were found to be unreliable in the study area, even at latitudes as low as 45degreesS. A specific problem has been identified to the west of Tasmania in the winter interpolated climatology which is likely an artefact of interpolation of sparse data. The poor coverage of valid MCSSTs during this time limits the data\'s application for many uses. Although the limitations of the MCSST data set are well recognised, the possibilities for ecological applications of these data remain largely unexplored and unquantified. The potential exists to maximize the information available from this and other similar data sets by determining the appropriate spatial and temporal scales at which they are best applied to biophysical models.

The cost and accuracy of using IKONOS imagery to map shallow-water marine environments is evaluated and compared directly to that using a suite of satellite and airborne instruments including Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM), Satellite Pour l\'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High-Resolution Visible (HRV) multispectral and panchromatic, and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). Evaluations were conducted in the Turks and Caicos Islands which are ideally suited to aquatic remote sensing because of the large areas of clear, shallow water containing a range of different habitats. Over 600 field sites were surveyed and used to define habitat categories, supervise image classification, and make an independent assessment of thematic map accuracy. For the high-resolution IKONOS imagery, pixel sizes were small enough to allow within-habitat textural information to be added to the classification. Making full use of this textural information in supervised classifications significantly improved (P<.01) thematic map accuracy for fine-level habitat discrimination (13 classes). Although significantly (P<.001) and almost 20% more accurate than Landsat TM, like other satellite-borne sensors, IKONOS data were unable adequately to discriminate 13 categories of coral, algal, and seagrass habitats (overall accuracy 50%). Comparison with CASI in a restricted area where only nine of these habitats were represented indicated that CASI (81% user accuracy) was significantly (P<.01) more accurate than IKONOS (64% user accuracy). Comparisons of IKONOS, Landsat TM, and CASI along a transect in the maximally penetrating blue part of the spectrum suggest that the poor descriptive resolution of satellite sensors is partly due to loss of radiance contrast, presumably as a result of atmospheric Rayleigh scattering. Problems of scattering, coupled with the relatively poor spectral resolution of satellite sensors such as IKONOS, currently constrain their use for fine-level marine habitat mapping. IKONOS data enabled significantly more accurate mapping at a geomorphological scale (e.g., coral vs. seagrass) than other satellite sensors except Landsat TM. While reasonably high accuracies (75%) were obtained for such coarse-level habitat mapping, Landsat TM was more cost-effective than IKONOS, even for small (50 km(2)) areas. IKONOS may only be a cost-effective option if (i) independent field data are available to identify habitat patches, (ii) the area to be mapped is fairly small (<500 km(2)), and (iii) small-scale (<10 in) habitat dynamics are to be monitored. IKONOS data are unlikely to identify deterioration in coral reefs directly because changes in community structure cannot be resolved spectrally from the satellite. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Its large field-of-view makes the observations strongly dependent on the Sun-target-sensor geometry. This paper presents the \"BiDirectional Compositing\" (BDC) method we designed for the VEGETATION operational line to normalise directional effects in 10-day global syntheses. For each spectral band and each pixel, BDC results every 10 days in one nadir view datum derived from the observations acquired at every orbit pass. BDC is based on two main ideas. Firstly, the length of the time window devoted to Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) retrieval is conceived as a variable in such a way that a constant number of cloud-free data is always available to fit the BRDF model. Secondly, BRDF retrieval is separated from data normalisation and compositing, which operates only on 10-day windows before the date of syntheses in order to keep the reflectances level of the most recent observations. As a reliable BRDF is always available from VEGETATION data, BDC is fully productive at a 10-day step. It allows to use one single method to derive global syntheses, which can be easily adapted for any large field-of-view optical sensor. Using VEGETATION data sets acquired on four regions of the world, we finally compare 10-day syntheses obtained by BDC to the ones derived with two versions of Maximum Value Compositing (MVC) differing by the performance in detection of clouds and aerosols. The seasonal and spatial coherence of reflectances and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are much larger on BDC than on MVC syntheses, both at a regional and pixel (km(2)) scale. Compared to the version of MVC that is presently used in the VEGETATION operational line, BDC smoothes 10-day fluctuations of reflectances and NDVI time series by a factor 2.8 on average.

Airborne laser altimeter waveform data was acquired using the Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery (SLICER) for a successional sequence of four, closed-canopy, deciduous forest stands in eastern Maryland. The four stands were selected so as to include a range of canopy structures of importance to forest ecosystem function, including variation in the height and roughness of the outermost canopy surface and the vertical organization of canopy stories and gaps. The character of the SLICER backscatter signal is described and a method is developed that accounts for occlusion of the laser energy by canopy surfaces, transforming the backscatter signal to a canopy height profile (CHP) that quantitatively represents the relative vertical distribution of canopy surface area. The transformation applies increased weighting to the backscatter amplitude as a function of closure through the canopy and assumes a horizontally random distribution of the canopy components. SLICER CHPs, averaged over areas of overlap where altimeter ground tracks intersect, are shown to be highly reproducible. CHP transects across the four stands reveal spatial variations in vegetation, at the scale of the individual 10-m-diameter laser footprints, within and between stands. Averaged SLICER CHPs are compared to analogous height profile results derived from ground-based sightings to plant intercepts measured on plots within the four stands. The plots were located on the segments of the altimeter ground tracks from which averaged SLICER CHPs were derived, and the ground observations were acquired within 2 weeks of the SLICER data acquisition to minimize temporal change. The differences in canopy structure between the four stands is similarly described by the SLICER and ground-based CHP results. However, a chi-square test of similarity documents differences that are statistically significant. The differences are discussed in terms of measurement properties that define the smoothness of the resulting CHPs and canopy properties that may vertically bias the CHP representations of canopy structure. The statistical differences are most likely due to the more noisy character of the ground-based CHPs, especially high in the canopy where ground-based sightings are rare resulting in an underestimate of canopy surface area and height, and to departures from assumptions of canopy uniformity, particularly regarding lack of clumping and vertically constant canopy reflectance, which bias the CHPs. The results demonstrate that the SLICER observations reliably provide a measure of canopy structure that reveals ecologically interesting structural variations such as those characterizing a successional sequence of closed-canopy, broadleaf forest stands.

To this aim, a methodology is proposed using L-KV SIR-C SAR data or AMAP alone or their coupling through a GIS for forest attributes retrieval and 3-D stand simulation.

Based on classification and change detection results all corrections improved the data analysis. The best overall results are achieved using a new method which adds the effect of Rayleigh scattering to conventional dark object subtraction. Though this method may not lead to accurate surface reflectance, it best minimizes the difference in reflectances within a land cover class through time as measured with the Jeffries-Matusita distance. Contrary to expectations, the more complicated algorithms do not necessarily lend to improved performance of classification and change detection. Simple dark object subtraction, with or without the Rayleigh atmosphere correction, or relative atmospheric correction are recommended for classification, and change detection applications.

While a traditional crisp partition only provides qualitative information, a fuzzy partition represents a large amount of quantitative information. However, such a partition is often evaluated after \"defuzzification\" (i.e., it is reduced to a crisp partition). The analysis of a traditional confusion matrix, describing the similarities between the computed crisp partition and a control partition, can then be performed. This approach is rather drastic and is far from satisfactory because the qualitative information is lost after the defuzzification. Some methods do not adequate to evaluate nonprobabilistic fuzzy partitions (i.e., fuzzy partitions such that the sum of the membership degrees is not necessarily equal to 1). To solve these issues, we consider the evaluation of any fuzzy partition mu as the evaluation of a still fuzzy new partition: the plausibilistic closure of mu. This approach comes from the theory of evidence. It allows definition of a set of original tools (plausibility matrices, credibility matrices, and overlap degrees) dedicated to fuzzy partition evaluation. A concrete application illustrates our theoretical work and a tutorial is provided in appendix. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.', 'Univ Missouri, Dept Comp Sci & Comp Engn, Columbia, MO USA.

Several estimates of water content based on the near-infra-red (SWIR) water absorption bands were compared to measurements of vegetation structure and water content made on the ground. The Water Index (WI) and Normalized Difference Water index (NDWI), reflectance indices formulated from the NIR water absorption bands, were the best indicators of canopy RWC estimated from combining leaf relative water content with measures of canopy structure. A stepwise multiple regression revealed that canopy structure explained 36% and 41% of the variation in WI and NDWI, respectively. The explained variance in WI and NDWI increased to 44% and 48% when leaf relative water content was included in the model. By contrast, the inclusion of leaf relative water content did not contribute significantly to the explained variance in indices formulated using SWIR water absorption bands and in those based on water thickness. The relationship between WI and the canopy RWC significantly improved when only data from plots with green vegetation cover >70% were considered (r(2)=0.88, p<0.001). All the indices studied had an important structural component (as indicated by the strong correlation with NDVI), yet only the indices WI and NDWI additionally responded to water content. These results indicate that the WI and NDWI are sensitive to variations in canopy relative water content at the landscape scale.

It describes the development and evaluation of an objective procedure to select a representative sample of tiles of high resolution images that complements a coarse coverage of an entire region of interest. The second article explores that use of the procedure for an accurate estimation of cover type composition at the regional scale. The Purposive Selection Algorithm (PSA) assumes that a relationship exists between land cover compositions at the two spatial scales. It selects one tile at a time, seeking the sample which most closely resembles the composition of the coarse resolution map. Two selection criteria were used, fraction of cover types and contagion index. PSA was evaluated using two land cover maps for a 288 kmx165 km area in central Saskatchewan, Canada derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper images (30 m pixels) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR, 1000 m pixels), each divided into 64 tiles. The performance of an intermediate sensor (480 m pixels) was assessed by resampling the TM map. When using cover type composition alone, it was found that the procedure rapidly converges on a representative set of tiles with land cover composition very similar to the full coverage. The match between the domain and sample cover type fractions was very close, with errors less than 0.002% once about 1/5 to 1/3 of the tiles were selected and no discernible bias in the selected sample. Compared to the TM whole area coverage, samples selected with AVHRR classification were as representative as those obtained using the TM map. The performance of samples selected by a combination of cover composition and contagion index responded to the characteristics of individual tiles in terms of the selection criteria. A rigorous application of the algorithm with spatial heterogeneity measures such as the contagion index is computationally very demanding. It is concluded that PSA provides an efficient and effective tool to select a representative sample for land cover studies in which both large area coverage and local detail are desired.

This urbanization occurred largely in response to pasture and low-density urban areas changing to high-density urban areas. The evolution in surface microclimate accompanying these changes differs considerably for the various types of urban surfaces, but ultimately the pixels become virtually indistinguishable from one another as urbanization becomes advanced. On the other hand deforestation, which occurred as trees were replaced by crops, did not result in large changes in surface temperature and wetness and may have produced increases with time in evapotranspiration.

In order of increasing vigor, treatments consisted of root pruning, control, thinning, and thinning in combination with fertilization. Concentrations of chlorophyll and nitrogen increased significantly from the low to high vigor plots, and shoot lengths increased by more than three times. Balsam fir shoots front each treatment were measured for reflectance under laboratory conditions by a portable spectroradiometer with a spectral range front 3.50 nm to 2500 nm. Reflectance decreased consistently with vigor throughout the spectral region analyzed. Most wavebands showed significant effects of the treatments, with the most significant wavebands in the region of chlorophyll absorption between 500 nm and 740 nm. Foliage age class and sample date also affected reflectance in these wavebands. Reflectance indices, defined as the ratio and normalized difference of the most significant waveband at 711 nm and the least significant waveband at 913 nm, were affected by the treatments (P<0.0001). The normalized difference index correlated strongly with concentrations of chlorophyll a (r(2)greater than or equal to 0.75), chlorophyll b (r(2)greater than or equal to 0.66), nitrogen (r(2)greater than or equal to 0.52), and shoots lengths (r(2)greater than or equal to 0.69), thereby comprising a spectral index of balsam fir vigor that integrates several aspects of forest physiological condition.

At the measurement plot scale, model inversions could not provide accurate information on cover or crown transmittance (a function of leaf area index, LAI) using only single-date TM data. A primary limitation was due to variations in other stand characteristics that could not be taken into account in the inversion process; including the background spectral signatures, stand structure, and spatial distribution of trees. A single value of a given parameter derived from inversion was associated with multiple values of that parameter as measured on the ground. The remote sensing derived parameters were grouped into classes based on homogeneous plot characteristics. From analysis of variance of the grouped data, the coverages derived by inversion, the NDVI, and the SAVI were found to be related to measured coverage at the 0.01 level. Crown transmittances derived from inversion were related to measured transmittances at the 0.01 level, although the indices were not found to be related to measured transmittance. The results indicate that the FLIM performs in a similar way to a physically based, nonlinear spectral index. Further work is needed to develop methods for incorporating additional inventory and remote sensing information into the inversion process. Work is also needed to investigate methods to relate the biophysical information derived from remote sensing to routine forest inventory variables, which are required in forest management.

NASA is scheduled to launch its first Earth Observing satellite System (EOS) with array of instructions for precise, scientific, remote sensing of the Earth land ocean, and atmospheres. One of the main instruments, MODIS, will monitor daily vegetation dynamics with seven specially selected and highly characterized and calibrated spectral channels in the solar spectrum, with spatial resolution from 250 m to 500 m. These MODIS data, together with multiangular observations from the MISR instrument (also on EOS), will generate a much better picture of vegetation dynamic than previous satellite data records. But studying changes on, the Earth surface takes years and decades. To do it in our scientific lifetime, there is a need to be able to develop a data series that combines the traditional NDVI-AVHRR data sets that was used to monitor vegetation dynamics with the new MODIS data with its narrower channels. Here we propose that due to spectral differences between the AVHRR and MODIS, a combination of the MODIS red and green channels should be used to represent the AVHRR red channel in such long term data series, to avoid a step in the NDVI of delta NDVI of up to 0.05. We use both leaf spectra and full canopy spectra to develop and test this optimization. Optimization of the MODIS sensitivity for monitoring the dynamics of vegetation chlorophyll content is also discussed.

Given high resolution imagery, a textural index could prove useful for mapping woody plant densities and monitoring woody plant encroachment across savanna landscapes. Spatial heterogeneity introduced through mixtures of herbaceous and woody plants challenges quantitative assessments of changing woody plant density using remotely sensed imagery. Moreover woody plant encroachment occurs across decadal time scales, restricting remote sensing analyses to historical aerial photograph records. Heterogeneity in vegetation structure has a significant influence on local pixel variance in high resolution images. We scanned black and white aerial photographs for 18 sites of valuing woody plant density, producing images of 2-m grain size. Omnidirectional variograms derived from these images had ranges of approximately 10 m and sills highly sensitive to woody plant density, prompting us to use a textural index to indicate landscape variation in woody plant density. For validation purposes, we measured several woody overstory structural parameters in the field a factor analysis revealed woody stem count as the best correlate with image texture. Significance of the regression of image texture on woody stem count declined as grain size of the 2-m images was coarsened to simulate that of SPOT and Landsat satellite sensors. At 10-m resolution, our textural index proved a significant indicator of woody plant density. We mosaicked sequential aerial photographs scanned at 10-m resolution and then applied oar textural filter, producing maps of historical woody plant distribution that reflected patterns in, soil and vegetation type More accurate maps of canopy structure and structural change are needed to explore potential effects of woody plant encroachment on biophysical and biogeochemical processes at large scales.

These new filters are also designed to minimize ringing near cloud edges-a problem often associated with earlier FIR filter designs used to remove striped noise in satellite data. Finally, the results obtained by using these new filtering methods are quantitatively compared with those produced by other destriping methods. Results from geostationary operational environment satellite (GOES-7) and the geostationary meteorological satellite (GMS-5) scenes show that both filters are superior to the other methods evaluated. Moreover, they are computationally efficient because they are implemented in. the spatial domain. Significant differences between the noise structure of GOES-7 and GMS-5 visible data also are discussed these differences appear not to be in the open literature. The new FIR filter designs can also be adapted for use with data taken with the improved VISSR-like instruments an the GOES-8 and GOES-9 satellites.

This processor operates in a sequential fashion to first classify terrain according to structural attributes and then apply class-specific retrievals for geophysical and biophysical properties. Structural and electrical attributes control the radar backscattering from terrain. Experimental data and theoretical results illustrate the sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar to structural properties, such as surface roughness and canopy architecture, to soil moisture and to the aboveground biomass of vegetation. and its moisture status. Accurate land-cover classification is of great value in many types of regional- to global-scale modeling, and is also an essential precursor to many techniques for extracting geophysical and biophysical information from SAR data. The sensitivity of SAR to the structural features of terrain leads to landcover classification into simple and easily interpreted structural classes. Knowledge-based, hierarchical classifiers require no a priori information or statistical understanding of a local scene, and are found to yield overall accuracy in excess of 90%. Classification using existing data fron the orbital ERS-1 and JERS-1 SARs yield unambiguous land-cover categorizations at greater accuracy and resolution than that afforded by an unsupervised classification of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as derived from multitemporal AVHRR data. Level I of the SAR terrain classifier differentiates three structural classes; surfaces, short vegetation, and tall vegetation. These classes can be quantized, averaged over the appropriate grid scab and used directly as roughness inputs to general circulation models. Level II of the classifier differentiates vegetation classes on the basis of growth form and leaf type. This level of structural classification is essential in order to improve the performance of semiempirical approaches for retrieving near-surface soil moisture and aboveground biomass.RP DOBSON, MC (通讯作者)，UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT ELECT ENGN & COMP SCI,RADIAT LAB,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 65, 131, 133, 1, 25, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBL CO INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The inversion method takes advantage of the sensitivity Of near-infrared snowpack reflectance to snow grain size. The Tioga Pass and Mammoth Mountain single-band AVIRIS radiance images were atmospherically corrected to obtain surface reflectance. Given the solar and viewing geometry for the time and location of each AVIRIS overflight, a discrete-ordinate model was used to calculate directional reflectance as a function Of snowpack grain size, for a wide range Of snow grain radii. The resulting radius vs. reflectance curves were each fit using a nonlinear least-squares technique which provided a means of transforming surface reflectance in each AVIRIS image to optically equivalent grain size on a per-pixel basis. This inversion technique has been validated using a combination of ground-based reflectance measurements and grain size measurements derived from stereologic analysis of snow samples for a wide range of snow grain sizes. The model results and grain size estimates derived from the AVIRIS data show that, for solar incidence angles between 0-degrees and 300, the technique provides good estimates of grain size.

For each image, both spectra are almost identical in form for scales between 2 and 256 km. For scales greater than approximately 5 km, spectral slopes can vary widely between cloud types, but for smaller scales they follow approximately k-3 in constancy with previous results. It is argued that abrupt scaling changes are to be expected at about typical cloud cell size, thus implying that satellite radiance variability is scale dependent. Furthermore, it is argued that application of existing generalized scale invariance techniques to satellite imagery should avoid crossing over the scale associated with typical cloud cell size. Monte Carlo methods of photon transport were used to demonstrate the similarities between spectral slopes for a cloud\'s vertical integral of optical depth tau(upsilon) and its corresponding reflected and emitted radiation fields. This suggests that the k-3 radiance spectra for shallow cumuliform clouds derives from cloud optical depths varying as approximately k-3 also. This, in turn, implies that if in shallow cumulus liquid water content (LWC) variability is isotropic, spectra of LWC transects should be close to k-2, as is often the case. Despite the spectral similarities, it is shown that the many-to-many relation between reflected radiance and tau(upsilon) can be quite pronounced, thus making inference of tau(upsilon) difficult.', 'MCMASTER UNIV,DEPT GEOG,HAMILTON L8S 4L8,ONTARIO,CANADA.', 'McMaster UniversityRP BARKER, HW (通讯作者)，ATMOSPHER ENVIRONM SERV,CANADIAN CLIMATE CTR,4905 DUFFERIN ST,TORONTO M3H 5T4,ONTARIO,CANADA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 30, 36, 38, 0, 3, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

An important factor not considered in these studies is the case of horizontally heterogeneous plant stands where the ground cover is usually less than 100%. We investigated the relationship between spectral indices and fraction of absorbed PAR in horizontally heterogeneous vegetation canopies with the aid of a three-dimensional radiative transfer model. Canopy reflection at optical wavelengths and PAR absorption was simulated using this model. The errors incurred in using a ID model for calculating the radiation regime of spatially heterogeneous canopies are shown to be significant. Our analysis indicates that the leaf area index of a canopy is less of an instructive parameter than ground cover and clump leaf area index for these canopies.

Grass blades are modeled as thin and finite dielectric ellipsoids with arbitrary orientations.  Scattering by an individual grass blade is formulated using a generalization of the Rayleigh-Gans approximation with a quasistatic solution for the expansion of the interior field.  By associating, with each grass blade, various appropriate distribution functions, the relative orientation, location, height, cross section, and permittivity of each grass blade is taken into account.  This makes for a more realistic overall description of the canopy.  Kirchhoff\'s surface scattering is used to model the backscatter from the soil surface.  An incoherent summation of the effect of grass blades and soil surface is adopted to obtain the total canopy backscattering coefficient, taking into account the attenutaion experienced by the signal as it travels through the canopy.  The results of this model are given for 1.5, 5, and 10 GHz (L-, C-, and X-band).

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with the advantages of all-weather operation and fine spatial resolutions has been utilized in various agricultural applications. Although the water cloud model (WCM) has been extensively used for LAI estimation over croplands, it is modified for application to crop canopies with large gaps. The requirement of prior information on soil moisture is also a hinderance for the model application. In this study, WCM is theoretically modified to consider the correlation of active microwave propagation through the canopy in downward and upward directions. Such a modification is particularly important for sparse vegetation with large gaps between crop plants in the early stage of the growing season. A parameter with explicit physical meaning, i.e. the full-vegetation backscattering coefficient, was defined to simplify our model scheme and make the model applicable for the whole growing season. In addition, a physicsbased SAR data processing scheme is developed to entangle the influences of LAI and soil moisture on SAR backscatter by taking advantage of the multiple polarizations of RADARSAT-2 (R2) SAR data. In this way, LAI was estimated using modified WCM without the prior knowledge of soil moisture. To evaluate LAI retrieved from the R2 datasets (R2 LAI), ground-based LAI measurements were made at the experimental area of SMAPVEX16MB in Canada with twenty approximately 800 m. 800 m plots in soybeans and corn. R2 LAI was well correlated to these ground-based LAI (n = 15, R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.99 m(2)center dot m-(2) for soybeans; n = 5, R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 1.20 m(2)center dot m(-2) for corn). LAI was also retrieved from optical data acquired by Sentinel-2/MSI (S2), denoted as S2 LAI. The R2 LAI and S2 LAI are well correlated and achieved coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.76 and 0.71 and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 1.1 and 1.4 m(2)center dot m(-2) for soybeans and corn, respectively. The seasonal variations of R2 LAI and S2 LAI are generally similar except at the end of the growing season when S2 LAI is considerably larger than R2 LAI. S2 LAI followed the trend of the reduction in leaf chlorophyll content, while R2 LAI reduced only slightly due to the decrease in leaf water content near the end the growing season. R-2 LAI represents the total standing leaf area useful for surface energy balance estimation, while S2 LAI responds to green leaf area useful for crop productivity modeling.', '[Wang, Rong; Chen, Jing M.; Liu, Jane] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Humid Subtrop Ecogeog Proc, Minist Educ, Fuzhou 350008, Peoples R China.

This paper presents the performance of the recently developed 9 km global SMAP product (hereafter SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX, SMAP-IB9). The product retrieves SM from the 9 km SMAP radiometric products using the forward model (L-MEB, L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) of SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) and SMOS L2 algorithms.

We found that ERA5-Land and SMAP-IB9 SM had the overall highest correlations (R = 0.62(+/- 0.15) for ERA5-Land vs. 0.60 (+/- 0.17) for SMAP-IB9 and 0.50(+/- 0.15) for SMAP-E) by comparing with the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) in-situ measurements from 22 networks.

However, a structurally diverse forest should have large variation in tree size (i.e., height and diameter), as well as some clustering of trees, as regular tree pattern is typical for managed forests. In this work we developed a framework for building structurally representative tree maps using airborne laser scanning data and a limited number of ground measurements using data from two locations in Finland. In the proposed method, an individual tree detection algorithm is optimized so that the number of undetected trees and false detections is minimized. The ground measurements are then used to train models for predicting the number and location of undetected trees and false detections by resampling the attributes of undetected trees in the training data. This model can then be applied to other areas in the proximity of the ground measurements to build tree maps, with the location, height, and diameter for each tree. The methodology was shown to reproduce the number of trees, the height distribution, and the spatial pattern of the trees with sufficient accuracy for practical use in large-scale mapping of forest attributes. For example, the individual tree detection could find at best about 54% of the trees with an additional 7% of false detections, resulting in a bias of approximately -30%, while with the new method the bias was reduced to +/- 10% of the stem density.

As a state-of-the-art DSI technology, the SqueeSAR approach considered the statistical behavior of the decorrelated DS and proposed the phase triangulation algorithm (PTA) as the pioneering implementation of the phase linking (PL) theory to estimate the equivalent single-reference (ESR) phases from all interferometric combinations. Subsequently, many advanced estimators of the systematic phase series have been introduced. Interestingly, this paper has demonstrated that the utilization of weakly coherent interferometric pairs is not conducive to the theoretical accuracy improvement of the PL theory in case of the fast decorrelation scenario. Moreover, the reduction of the small baseline scales will worsen the positive definite degree of the time series coherence matrix, which makes the ill-posed solution problem more serious. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel adaptive PL (AdpPL) method integrating the following two innovations for mapping surface deformation: 1) in terms of the interferometric pair selection optimization (IPSO), this paper performs the homogeneity measure-based IPSO (HoMeIPSO) method to remove the lowly coherent candidate subset progressively and select the moderate interferometric pairs adaptively; 2) in terms of the robust parameter estimation, an adaptive regularization (AdpReg) approach suggests selecting an optimal damping factor according to the minimum fitting error of all interferogram observables. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can restore the systematic phase series more clearly and detect the deformation area with spatially highly dynamic characteristics successfully.', '[Shen, Peng; Wang, Changcheng; An, Bei] Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Info Phys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.', 'Central South UniversityRP Wang, CC (通讯作者)，Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Info Phys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.', 'wangchangcheng@csu.edu.cn', 'An, Bei/0000-0003-1381-3476', 'National Key Research and Development Program of China [2022YFB3903304];   Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China [2022JJ30705];   National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671356]', 'This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development   Program of China (No. 2022YFB3903304) , the Natural Science Foundation   of Hunan Province, China (No. 2022JJ30705) and the National Natural   Science Foundation of China (No. 41671356) .

The seasonal variation of lake water level (LWLsv) and storage (LWSsv) reflects the periodic hydrologic fluctuations and related driving forces of the water balances at the basin scale. China, a vastly diverse country that descends from the \"Roof of the World\" to monsoonal coast zones, hosts a wide distribution of lakes with diverse hydro-climatological and topographic features. Most previous studies focused on monitoring long-term changes of lakes in China, while the seasonality (mostly regarding the lake area) of lake hydrologic dynamics was only investigated for typical lakes or local basins/zones due to the limited spatial coverage and temporal resolution of various observation data. Benefiting from the finer footprints and increased beams of ICESat-2 laser altimeter, we examined the seasonal variations of LWLsv of Chinese lakes (3473 lakes historically larger than 1 km2 during the 1980s-2010s) on a national scale from 2019 to 2021. Then, the machine learning algorithm termed the extreme gradient boosting tree was employed to model the LWLsv of the lakes that were not monitored by ICESat-2. We further quantized the national-scale LWSsv by combining the LWLsv estimates and lake area data. Results show that the mean LWLsv of the 1255 lakes observed by ICESat-2 during 2019-2021 is 0.44 & PLUSMN; 0.07 m. Among them, 1167 lakes have the LWLsv <1 m, and 12 lakes have the LWLsv exceeding 3 m. The accuracy evaluation indicates that the XGBoost model performs well in predicting LWLsv results for unobserved lakes, with the coefficient of determination of 0.76, the mean absolute error of 0.14 m, and the root mean square error of 0.03 m. Overall, the predicted LWLsv of unobserved lakes has a similar spatial pattern to that of the observed lakes. The LWSsv is estimated at 77.29 & PLUSMN; 6.87 Gt in total, but exhibits obvious spatial heterogeneity in China. The Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River Basin and the endorheic Qiangtang Plateau Basin rank the first two contributors of the net LWSsv, which were respectively attributed to the most significant LWLsv changes and the largest lake group area. This national-scale quantification of the LWLsv and LWSsv helps advance our scientific understanding of the seasonal hydrologic behaviors for Chinese lakes in regulating the water cycle and providing a valuable reference for regional water resource management.', '[Song, Lijuan; Song, Chunqiao; Luo, Shuangxiao; Chen, Tan; Liu, Kai; Zhang, Yunlin] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.

Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) techniques have been developed to integrate multi-resolution satellite images to produce data with high spatial resolution and temporal frequency. Due to the large volume and diversity of higher resolution global Earth Observation (EO) data, large-scale data processing methods need to be computationally efficient, free of parameter fine-tuning, and adaptive to various data structures without process customization. These requirements are especially critical for the production of global Seamless Data Cube (SDC). Considering the limitations of existing STF methods, we propose a ROBust OpTimization-based (ROBOT) fusion model that exploits time-series information to obtain more accurate predictions. ROBOT maintains stable under varied data conditions by adopting a temporal-coherence regularization term. And being free of parameter tuning, ROBOT can be applied to arbitrary spatiotemporally distributed data without repetitive process customization. Its performance was compared with eight representative STF methods. Results show that ROBOT outperforms existing STF methods in most cases and is computationally efficient, about 4000-fold faster than ESTARFM and 600-fold faster than FSDAF. The proposed method has demonstrated its potential for global-scale SDC generation to support subsequent remote sensing applications.', '[Chen, Shuang; Gong, Peng] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

It causes significant uncertainties in estimating surface upward longwave radiation (SULR) from space observations. In this regard, kernel-driven models (KDMs) are suitable to remove TRD effects from remote sensing dataset as they are computationally efficient. However, KDMs requires simultaneous multiangle observations as inputs to be well calibrated, which yields a difficulty with geostationary satellites as they can only provide a single-angle observation. To overcome this issue, we proposed a six-parameter time-evolving KDM that combines a four-parameter SULR diurnal variation model and a two-parameter TRD amplitude model to correct the TRD effect for single-angle estimated SULR dataset of geostationary satellites. The significant daytime TRD effect when solar zenith angle is within 60 degrees can be effectively eliminated. The modeling accuracy of the time-evolving KDM is evaluated using a simulated SULR dataset generated by the 3D Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model; the TRD correction method based on the new time-evolving KDM is validated using a two-year single-angle estimated SULR dataset derived from data of the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) against in situ measurements at 20 AmeriFlux sites. Results show that the proposed time-evolving KDM has a high accuracy with an R2 > 0.999 and a small RMSE = 1.5 W/m2; the TRD correction method based on the time-evolving KDM can greatly reduce the GOES-16 SULR uncertainty caused by the TRD effect with an RMSE decrease of 4.5 W/m2 (22.1%) and mean bias error decrease of 7.9 W/m2 (62.7%). Hence, the proposed TRD correction method is practically efficient for the operational TRD correction of SULR products generated from the geostationary satellites (e.g., GOES-16, FY-4A, Himawari-8, MSG).', '[Qin, Boxiong; Cao, Biao; Bian, Zunjian; Du, Yongming; Li, Hua; Xiao, Qing; Liu, Qinhuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Different altimeter missions lead to different gravity grids with varying spatial resolutions and accuracies. Marine gravity accuracy in offshore waters is often low. Integrating marine gravity anomalies (MGA) derived from various altimeter missions are key to obtaining high-precision and high-resolution global marine gravity fields. Here an improved triple collocation (ITC) method is first proposed to establish a new 1 \' x1 \' marine gravity anomaly in the South China Sea (SCS), named MGAITC, by merging the grids of MGA from the Haiyang-2A (HY-2A), CryoSat-2, and ICESat-2 altimeter measurements. A combined MGA (MGACOM) is also constructed by using the least squares collocation (LSC) method from three sets of altimeter-derived geoid gradients. The qualities of MGAITC, MGACOM and each altimeter-derived MGA grids are assessed using shipborne gravity and different global gravity models over waters of varying depths and distances from the coastline. The accuracy of the MGAITC gravity against the shipborne gravity is 5.52 mGal, which represents improvements of 7%, 9%, 13%, and 3% relative to the gravity grids derived only from ICESat-2, CryoSat-2, HY-2A and from MGACOM. In all assessments involving different subregions, seafloors, and distances from the coastline, MGAITC performs the best, and ICESat-2 yields the best single-mission MGA grid, especially in offshore waters. We find that ICESat-2 has a high potential to improve shallow-water gravity accuracy and the global marine gravity field can be improved by integrating gravity grids from different altimetry missions using ITC.', '[Chao, Nengfang; Wang, Shuai; Ouyang, Guichong; Yue, Lianzhe; Chen, Gang; Zhang, Yanze] China Univ Geosci, Coll Marine Sci & Technol, Key Lab Geol Survey & Evaluat, China Hubei Key Lab Marine Geol Resources,Minist E, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.

However, the measurement points generated by InSAR are too many to be manually analyzed, and automatic subsidence detection and classification methods are still lacking. In this study, we developed an oriented R-CNN deep learning network to automatically detect and classify subsidence bowls using InSAR measurements and multi-source ancillary data. We used 541 Sentinel-1 images acquired during 2015-2021 to map land subsidence of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area by resolving persistent and distributed scatterers. Multi-source data related to land subsidence, including geological and lithological, land cover, topographic, and climatic data, were incorporated into deep learning, allowing the local subsidence to be classified into seven categories. The results showed that the oriented R-CNN achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.847 for subsidence detection and a mean AP (mAP) of 0.798 for subsidence classi-fication, which outperformed the other three state-of-the-art methods (Rotated RetinaNet, R3Det, and ReDet). An independent effect analysis showed that incorporating all datasets improved the AP by 11.2% for detection and the mAP by 73.9% for classification, respectively, compared with using InSAR measurements only. Combining InSAR measurements with globally available land cover and digital elevation model data improved the AP for subsidence detection to 0.822, suggesting that our methods can be potentially transferred to other regions, which was further validated this using a new dataset in Shanghai. These results improve the understanding of deltaic subsidence and facilitate geohazard assessment and management for sustainable environments.', '[Wu, Zherong; Ma, Peifeng; Zheng, Yi; Gu, Feng] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Space & Earth Informat Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

Estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) often requires thermal information; however, not every satellite is equipped with a thermal sensor, which limits the estimation of ETa. To address this limitation, here we propose a satellite-based ETa estimation model, OPTRAM-ET, based on the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) estimates of soil moisture and a vegetation index (VI). We applied the OPTRAM-ET model to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data and evaluated the model for ETa estimates using 16 eddy covariance flux towers in the United States and Germany with different landcover types, including agriculture, orchard, permanent wetland, and foothill forests. Next, OPTRAM-ET was compared with the conventional land surface temperature (LST)-VI model. The proposed OPTRAM-ET model showed promising performance over all the studied landcover types. In addition, OPTRAM-ET showed comparable performance to the conventional LST-VI model. However, since the OPTRAM-ET model does not need thermal data, it benefits from higher spatial and temporal resolution data provided by ever-increasing drone-and satellite-based optical sensors to predict crop water status and demand. Unlike the LST-VI model, which needs to be calibrated for each satellite image, a temporally-invariant region-specific calibration is possible in the OPTRAM-ET model. Therefore, OPTRAM-ET is substantially less computationally demanding than the LST-VI model.', '[Mokhtari, Ali; Afrasiabian, Yasamin; Yu, Kang] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Precis Agr Lab, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.

Although various satellite SAR datasets have been analyzed to monitor subsidence in the Beijing Plain, no multi-decadal scale deformation measurement has been derived from multi-sensor InSAR results, and the recent deceleration of land subsidence or even uplift remains unclear. This study retrieved land subsidence measurements over the past three decades (1992-2022) by integrating multi-sensor C-band InSAR measurements into a logistic model. The cu-mulative subsidence presented three major subsidence funnels surrounding downtown in the North, Northeast, and East, with the maximum vertical displacement as high as 1.98 m in the Chaoyang District. The land sub-sidence positively responded to the changes in groundwater depth, showing a clear deceleration since 2016. After five and half years, it became almost stagnated within the context of continuous groundwater recovery, which implied the delayed compaction of lowly draining aquitards. Only slight residual subsidence persisted in Chaoyang, Shunyi, and Daxing Districts. Meanwhile, land uplift happened in Shunyi, Huairou, and Pinggu Districts. Remarkably, a portion of the land subsidence in the Chaobai Plain reversed to uplift due to multiple artificial recharges using diverted water. Although groundwater storage could recover significantly in the next decade, most severely sunken lands and inelastically compacted aquitards are irrecoverable, leading to a per-manent loss of storage capacity in the Beijing Plain. This study provides scientific data support for the local government decision-maker to better manage groundwater resources and mitigate land subsidence, which pre-sents a typical example of monitoring long-term land subsidence in similar global megacities.', '[Dong, Jie; Guo, Shaokun; Gong, Jianya] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

However, existing studies have relied on field surveys that do not allow for large-scale analysis. Although remote sensing data have been used for local and regional monitoring of the vegetation upper boundaries, a global synthesis of the treeline and vegetation line (the upper altitudinal threshold for the existence of trees and the transition line from vegetation to bare land or permanent snow cover, respectively) in high-mountain ecosystems is still missing. To fill this gap, we developed two independent methods based on (1) the relationship between a Sentinel-2 vegetation index and elevation and (2) the European Space Agency\'s 10 m resolution land cover dataset (WorldCover), respectively, to automatically identify the upper elevational limits of treeline and vegetation line for each one-quarter degree grid across the global high-mountain areas. We obtained highly consistent results from the two methods, both of which are spatially consistent with ground surveyed treeline elevations. Our results are in line with the current understanding of the global distributions of tree and vegetation lines, which are observed at the highest elevations in the Tibetan plateau and decreasing for increasing latitudes. We find that the tree and vegetation lines are aspect dependent, reaching higher elevations on the equatorial-facing slopes than on the polar-facing slopes in high latitudes, and the opposite in the middle latitudes. Our analysis shows that mountain height is the dominant factor in determining the upper elevational limits of tree and vegetation lines across the globe, while climatic conditions and soil properties also play important roles at regional scales. Our study provides a framework for monitoring the tree and vegetation lines in global high-mountains and provides an important benchmark for further examining their long-term changes in response to climate change.', '[Zou, Linqing; Tian, Feng; Liang, Tianchen; Dou, Yujie; He, Tao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Hubei Key Lab Quantitat Remote Sensing Land & Atmo, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

As a consequence, the quantity and the quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that is transported via the Mackenzie River into the Arctic Ocean is expected to change. Particularly in these remote permafrost regions of the Arctic, monitoring of terrigenous organic carbon fluxes is insufficient and knowledge of distribution and fate of organic carbon when released to the coastal waters is remarkably lacking. Despite its poorly evaluated performance in Arctic coastal waters, Satellite Ocean Colour Remote Sensing (SOCRS) remains a powerful tool to complement monitoring of land-ocean DOC fluxes, detect their trends, and help in understanding their propagation in the Arctic Ocean.In this study, we use in situ and SOCRS data to show the strong seasonal dynamics of the Mackenzie River plume and the spatial distribution of associated terrigenous DOC on the Beaufort Sea Shelf for the first time. Using a dataset collected during an extensive field campaign in 2019, the performance of three commonly-used atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms and two available colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) retrieval algorithms were evaluated using the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). Our results showed that in optically-complex Arctic coastal waters the Polymer AC algorithm performed the best. For the retrieval of CDOM, the gsmA algorithm (Mean Percentage Error (MPE) = 35.7%) showed slightly more consistent results compared to the ONNS algorithm (MPE = 37.9%). By merging our measurements with published datasets, the newly -established DOC-CDOM relationship for the Mackenzie-Beaufort Sea region allowed estimations of DOC con-centrations from SOCRS across the entire fluvial-marine transition zone with an MPE of 20.5%. Finally, we applied SOCRS with data from the Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor to illustrate the seasonal variation of DOC concen-trations in the surface waters of the Beaufort Sea on a large spatial scales and high frequency throughout the entire open water period. Highest DOC concentrations and largest lateral extent of the plume were observed in spring right after the Mackenzie River ice break-up indicating that the freshet was the main driver of plume propagation and DOC distribution on the shelf. Satellite-derived images of surface water DOC concentration placed the in situ observations into a larger temporal and spatial context and revealed a strong seasonal vari-ability in transport pathways of DOC in the Mackenzie-Beaufort Sea region.', '[Juhls, B.; El Kassar, J.] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Geosci, Inst Meteorol, Carl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany.

Flood extents were classified using a semi-automatic tile-based histogram thresholding approach and refined using a series of post processing filters. These included multi-temporal filters which exploited the timing and orbit position of the Sentinel-1 satellite to identify likely false positives, and contextual information based filters which used external information such as topography and land use to estimate the likelihood of flooding and constrain its extent. A topographic correction algorithm was also applied to hydrologically-correct flood bodies. The methodology produced a user accuracy of above 0.95 for each annual map when compared to observed flood level data, overall accuracy values above 0.97 and kp values above 0.7 when compared to mapping process based on Sentinel-2 validation imagery, and the capacity to detect over 90% of recorded permanent water bodies larger than 2 ha.

In urban and suburban areas, satellite-based NO2 can be used as a proxy to track the emissions of CO2ff. Because of NO2\'s shorter lifetime, urban NO2 plumes are more distinguishable from backgrounds and more sensitive to variations in emissions. However, the combination of these two gases is limited by the asynchrony among NO2 and CO2 monitoring satellites. We used CO2ff simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model to reconcile the tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) from Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide enhancements (Delta XCO2) from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3) Snapshot Area Maps (SAMs) over a multicity area, Washington D.C.-Baltimore (DC-Balt), and a basin city, Mexico City. NO2/CO2ff ratios over DC-Balt are smaller than Mexico City, indicative of stricter emission restrictions, a more combustionefficient vehicle fleet, and higher combustion efficiency due to lower altitude in DC-Balt. For single-track cases, the spatial correlations between NO2 and Delta XCO2 over Mexico City are stronger than DC-Balt because the NO2 and CO2 are mostly trapped in the valley of Mexico City, while DC-Balt is severely affected by distant sources (i. e., US East Coast cities). Using multi-track averaging, spatial correlation coefficients increase with the number of days used for averaging. The correlations reached a maximum when averaging >12 continuous images for DCBalt and >10 continuous images for Mexico City. This finding indicates that multi-track averaging using modeled CO2ff as a proxy is helpful to filter the noise in single-track images, to cancel the interference from distant sources, and to magnify correlations between NO2 and CO2ff. Mexico City showed stronger spatial correlations but weaker temporal correlations than DC-Balt due to biomass burning hot spots and large transport errors caused by the trapping effects of the surrounding mountains. Tracking the 20-day moving average of CO2ff emissions using TROPOMI NO2 seems technically feasible, considering the relationship between correlation coefficients and the number of available satellite images.', '[Lei, Ruixue; Feng, Sha] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, University Pk, PA USA.

The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) is the first space-based thermal imaging instrument that allows for a study of diurnal LST and ET dynamics at a moderate spatial resolution (70 x 70 m).   We quantified, compared, and modeled the LST and ET dynamics of two groups of forest restoration sites (43 sites in total, between 2 and 75 ha) in Southern Ontario, Canada that were initially restored from mainly agriculture between 2007 and 2019. We included all useable LST (n = 29) and ET (n = 9) ECOSTRESS image products from a full growing season in 2020 (June 1st to September 30th). Forest restoration sites were compared by age and against agriculture (pre-restoration state), mature forest (post-restoration state), and suburban residential sites (competing land use).   The ability of forest restoration sites to buffer temperatures was highest in the afternoon, around 14:00 local time (EDT). As predicted, restoration sites were significantly cooler ((x) over bar 4.4-7.4 degrees C) than residential and agricultural areas and significantly warmer (x.1.6-2.9 degrees C) compared to mature reference forest sites at both groups of sites. Relative diurnal (24-h) LST variability of forest and restoration sites was also significantly lower (0.9-2.9 degrees C) compared to agriculture and residential sites (3.3-5.2 degrees C). Daytime LST decreased significantly by 0.1 degrees C (3.1%), per year since restoration for one of the groups of sites relative to nearby mature reference forest sites as per a linear mixed effects regression model. It would take these sites similar to 30 years to reach the same buffering as mature forests. In characterizing ET dynamics of a subset of sites, we found that more recently restored sites had a statistically significant higher overall ET than older ones and that daytime relative instantaneous ET decreased with years since restoration. The variation explained by the ET model was however low.   Our study provides insights into how diurnal forest ecosystem energy conversion and storage dynamics changes over time after restoration. These diurnal thermal dynamics impact wildlife habitat as well as human wellbeing. The change in thermal buffering over time could be used to assess the pace and trajectory of restoration by managers. The thermal buffering provided by restored forest can also be quantified as an ecosystem service. As such, the study demonstrates the utility and also limitations of novel thermal remote sensing methods, using free and publicly available imagery from ECOSTRESS.', '[Hamberg, L.

However, the mechanistic understanding remains elusive. Long-term satellite observations (2007-2020) of aerosol properties during CRB season (Oct 20th to Nov 20th) indicate a distinct airshed of CRB plume transport from Northwestern India (source region) to greater Delhi (downwind region). Theoretically, the smoke concentration should disperse downwind, and the CRB-associated PM2.5 enhancement over Northern India should be inversely proportional to the distance from the CRB source region. However, the in-situ PM2.5 observations illustrate that smoke-associated enhancement in PM2.5 over greater Delhi (downwind region) is disproportionately large compared to the source region. In this study, we examine satellite, radiosonde, and ground-based observations along with reanalysis data to provide robust evidence that aerosol-boundary layer - PM2.5 associations via semi-direct effect can explain the above heterogeneity. Vertically resolved satellite observations indicate that as the emitted CRB-smoke plumes travel downwind, a portion of the transported smoke plume injected relatively at a higher altitude leads to the formation of an elevated smoke layer over greater Delhi. These elevated smoke layers tend to suppress the mixing height via inducing strong temperature inversion, thereby severely constraining the daytime dilution effect of shallow boundary layers. Along with direct advection of smoke particles, enhanced accumulation of local urban emissions due to these semi-direct impacts can lead to the observed disproportionate PM2.5 enhancements over Delhi during CRB haze periods. Thus, control of the local anthropogenic emissions could bring relief during the extreme haze episodes over Delhi.', '[Mhawish, Alaa; Bilal, Muhammad; Qiu, Zhongfeng] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that SM climatology estimates provided by L-band microwave RS retrievals can significantly outperform comparable estimates derived from LSMs. Consequently, neglecting a RS-based SM climatology may lead to degraded SM spatial patterns generated by land DA. Here, we propose a climatology-optimized SM DA framework, which first calibrates LSM parameters to leverage the RS SM climatology information. Next, multi-sensor RS SM retrievals are assimilated into the calibrated LSM using Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). This framework is demonstrated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and RS SM retrievals derived from the L-band Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and C-band Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) sensors. Here, both SMAP and ASCAT SM retrievals are assimilated into the VIC model after calibrating VIC to match spatial variations captured in the SMAP SM climatology. The DA SM results are validated using in-situ SM observations derived from 820 stations. Results show that SMAP-based SM clima-tology calibration directly improves the quality of SM spatial patterns estimated by VIC. In addition, the SMAP-based calibration also benefits our model-error representation and thereby yields better Kalman gains that improve temporal SM DA accuracy. Relative to typical DA approaches, this newly proposed DA framework improves both spatial (0.26 versus 0.51 (-)) and temporal correlations (0.48 versus 0.52 (-)) versus in-situ SM observations. In addition, SM improvements are effectively propagated into improved streamflow estimates - leading to an average increase of Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient from 0.74 to 0.76 (-). Overall, we demonstrate that RS SM climatology information is valuable for land DA and our climatology-optimized framework suc-cessfully retains such information to the benefit of land DA performance.', '[Zhou, Jianhong; Wu, Zhiyong; He, Hai; Feng, Huihui] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.

Individual tree species classification in subtropical forests remains challenging as existing individual tree segmentation algorithms typically result in over-segmentation in subtropical broadleaf forests, in which tree crowns often have multiple peaks. In this study, we proposed a watershed-spectral-texture-controlled normalized cut (WST-Ncut) algorithm, and applied it to delineate individual trees in a subtropical broadleaf forest situated in Shenzhen City of southern China (114 degrees 23 \' 28 \'\' E, 22 degrees 43 \' 50 \'\' N). Using this algorithm, we first obtained accurate crown boundary of individual broadleaf trees. We then extracted different suites of vertical structural, spectral, and textural features from UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data, and used these features as inputs to a random forest classifier to classify 18 tree species. The results showed that the proposed WST-Ncut algorithm could reduce the over-segmentation of the watershed segmentation algorithm, and thereby was effective for delineating individual trees in subtropical broadleaf forests (Recall = 0.95, Precision = 0.86, and F-score = 0.91). Combining the structural, spectral, and textural features of individual trees provided the best tree species classification results, with overall accuracy reaching 91.8%, which was 10.2%, 13.6%, and 19.0% higher than that of using spectral, structural, and textural features alone, respectively. In addition, results showed that better individual tree segmentation would lead to higher accuracy of tree species classification, but the increase of the number of tree species would result in the decline of classification accuracy.', '[Qin, Haiming; Zhou, Weiqi; Yao, Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.

Bomas protect livestock from predation by wildlife and potential theft. Due to the concentration of animal faeces inside bomas, they not only become nutrient-rich patches that can add to biodiversity, but also hotspots for the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas, especially when animals are kept inside for long periods. To provide an accurate estimate of such emissions for wider landscapes, bomas need to be accounted for. Moreover, initial experiments indicated that more frequent shifts in the boma locations could help to reduce N2O emissions. This stresses the need for better understanding where bomas are located, their numbers, as well as when they are actively used. Given the recent advances in satellite technology, resulting in high-frequent spectral measurements at fine spatial resolution, solutions to address these needs are now within reach. This study is a first effort to map and monitor the appearance of bomas with the use of satellite image time series. Our main dataset was a dense times series of 3 m resolution PlanetScope multi -spectral imagery. In addition, a reference dataset of boma and non-boma locations was created using GPS-collar tracking data and 0.5 m resolution Pleiades imagery. The reduction of vegetation cover and increase of organic material following boma installation result in typical spectral changes when contrasted against its surroundings. Based on these spectral changes we devised an empirical approach to infer approximate boma installation dates from PlanetScope\'s near infrared (NIR) band and used our reference dataset for setting optimal parameter values. A NIR spatial difference index resulted in clear temporal patterns, which were more apparent during the wet season. At landscape scale our approach reveals clear spatio-temporal patterns of boma installation, which could not be revealed from less frequent sub-meter resolution imagery alone. While further improvements are possible, we show that small-sized (150-500 m(2)) temporary surface changes, such as those that occur when pastoralists use mobile bomas, can be detected with dense image time series like those offered by the PlanetScope constellation. In future, this could lead to better assessment of a) spatio-temporal livestock distribution, b) the contribution of bomas to N2O emissions and soil fertility at landscape scale, and c) the uptake of enclosure rotation practices at large spatial scales.', '[Vrieling, Anton; Groen, Thomas] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

We propose a new framework to derive dynamic hydrologic corrections of rainfall in headwater basins that enforces water budget closure, and distributes transient rainfall corrections by Lagrangian backtracking along runoff trajectories constrained by realistic time-of-travel distributions. Downscaled QPE products (250 m resolution) are applied first as input to a distributed hydrologic model to predict runoff trajectories and the event hydrograph at the basin\'s outlet. Second, time-varying rainfall corrections are derived from the residuals between predicted and observed discharge at the outlet. Finally, the corrections are spatially distributed following the runoff trajectories backward (i.e. trajectories are used as streaklines originating at the basin\'s outlet). Because nonlinear interactions between rainfall, runoff and storage are transient, the corrections are applied recursively until the shape and volume of the predicted hydrograph are stable. The framework is applied to ground-based (e.g. Stage IV) and satellite-based remote-sensing QPEs (e.g. IMERG) associated with the 49 largest floods 2008-2018 in the Southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. The results show improvements in hydrograph prediction efficiency skill at 15 min timescale from-0.5 to 0.6 on average and up to 0.9 for warm season events, bounding event runoff volume errors with a mean of 3%, and reducing time to peak errors by half an hour on average. Corrected QPEs exhibit nearly perfect correlation and no bias at high elevation gauge locations. Uncertainty in the water budget closure at the event scale is less than the uncertainty in streamflow measurements. Error attribution shows strong organization of QPE corrections according to seasonal weather and rainfall regime, thus providing a path to generalization to ungauged mountain basins.', '[Liao, Mochi] Duke Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC USA.

Accurate estimates of inundation extent and its variations across spatial and temporal scales are therefore fundamental to understand and manage the basin\'s resources. More than fifty inundation estimates have been generated for this region, yet major differences exist among the datasets, and a comprehensive assessment of them is lacking. Here we present an intercomparison of 29 inundation datasets for the Amazon basin, based on remote sensing only, hydrological modeling, or multisource datasets, with 18 covering the lowland Amazon basin (elevation <500 m, which includes most Amazon wetlands), and 11 covering individual wetland complexes (subregional datasets). Spatial resolutions range from 12.5 m to 25 km, and temporal resolution from static to monthly, spanning up to a few decades. Overall, 31% of the lowland basin is estimated as subject to inundation by at least one dataset. The long-term maximum inundated area across the lowland basin is estimated at 599,700 +/- 81,800 km2 if considering the three higher quality SAR-based datasets, and 490,300 +/- 204,800 km2 if considering all 18 datasets. However, even the highest resolution SAR-based dataset underestimates the maximum values for individual wetland complexes, suggesting a basin-scale underestimation of ~10%. The minimum inundation extent shows greater disagreements among datasets than the maximum extent: 139,300 +/- 127,800 km2 for SAR-based ones and 112,392 +/- 79,300 km2 for all datasets. Discrepancies arise from differences among sensors, time periods, dates of acquisition, spatial resolution, and data processing algorithms. The median total area subject to inundation in medium to large river floodplains (drainage area > 1000 km2) is 323,700 km2. The highest spatial agreement is observed for floodplains dominated by open water such as along the lower Amazon River, whereas intermediate agreement is found along major vegetated floodplains fringing larger rivers (e.g., Amazon mainstem floodplain). Especially large disagreements exist among estimates for interfluvial wetlands (Llanos de Moxos, Pacaya-Samiria, Negro, Roraima), where inundation tends to be shallower and more variable in time.

Studies have focused on the LST gap reconstruction; however, most interpolation-based methods only work for a short-term cloud duration and are unable to adequately compensate for cloud effects, and traditional surface energy balance (SEB)-based methods are able to handle cloud coverage while they are not feasible for use at night. Moreover, few studies have concentrated on recovering the abnormal retrievals of partial cloud pixels. In this study, an all-sky diurnal, hourly LST estimation method based on SEB theory was proposed; the proposed method involved three major steps: 1) an original spatiotemporal dynamic model of LST was constructed from ECMWF Reanalysis v.5 (ERA5); 2) clear-sky ABI LST was then assimilated to the dynamic model to generate a continuous LST series; 3) the diurnal cloud effects were superimposed on cloudy time estimated by an innovative optimization method from satellite radiation products. A 2-km, all-sky, hourly LST product was produced over the contiguous US and Mexico from July 2017 to June 2021. Validation was conducted using ground measurements at 18 sites from Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) and core AmeriFlux networks, and produced an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.44 K, a bias of-0.19 K, and an R-2 of 0.97 based on 408,300 samples. For clear-sky samples, the RMSE values were 2.37 and 2.24 K for day and nighttime, respectively, which was a notable improvement over the corresponding values of the official ABI LST product (2.73 and 2.86 K, respectively). The RMSE values on cloudy-sky were 2.78 and 2.23 K for day and nighttime, respectively. The daily mean LST by aggregating all-sky, hourly LST had an RMSE of 1.13 K and R-2 of 0.99. Overall, this product showed reliability under consistent cloud durations, although it was slightly affected by surface elevation. The diurnal temperature cycle climatology of major land cover types was also characterized.

Changes in terrestrial water storage produce responses in the Earth\'s gravitational field and crustal deformation. Here, we use techniques from the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to reveal a normal pattern of inter-annual fluctuations in the water level in the North American Great Lakes (GL). The GRACE-estimated time series was in good agreement with in situ water level measurements from 2002 to 2018, especially in terms of phases. The amplitude of 3-4 inter-annual signals in water thickness was 4-6 cm, which is equivalent to a 50-75 km(3) oscillation in surface water volume within the entire GL. The slightly larger annual and inter-annual fluctuation amplitudes estimated using GRACE data indicate that the aquifer system of the GL and its surroundings also contributes to seasonal mass changes. After 2013, water levels in the GL region rose abruptly, and the water mass increased by nearly 270 km(3) until the end of 2018. We also used GPS-and GRACE-derived three-component displacements (vertical, northward, and eastward) to identify load patterns. GPS-and GRACE-estimated maximum probability source directions based on multi-channel singular spectrum analysis showed that most of the selected GPS sites point to the GL region, although the direction deviations of GPS results at a few sites are mainly caused by the combined effect of the local load and superposition of the distant GL. Our findings indicate that inter-annual displacement changes at different frequencies (1-to 8-year cycle) are primarily due to water volume fluctuations in the GL. The amplitudes estimated by GPS are greater than the GRACE-based and GL-modeled results at most stations, which reflects sensitivity differences between these geodetic solutions to the surface load, as hydrological processes in the local area around a station are difficult to identify using GRACE data with a resolution of similar to 300 km.', '[Wang, Linsong; Peng, Zhenran; Chen, Chao] China Univ Geosci, Inst Geophys & Geomat, Hubei Subsurface Multiscale Imaging Key Lab, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Regarding the specific wave mode, to date, the previous empirical models for estimating SWH from SAR data rely on single polarization. In the emerging deep learning era, few published quad-polarized SAR SWH retrieval algorithms have been based on machine learning technique, and whether quad-polarimetry improves the skill of wave height estimation remains a question. Here we propose a deep residual convolutional neural network-based SAR SWH retrieval algorithm in quad-polarization. By collocating WaveWatch III sea state hindcasts and all available archives of quad-polarized Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR imagettes in wave mode, a database with approximately 30,000 matchups was employed to establish our deeply-learned network. The GaoFen-3 significant wave height retrievals were validated against the hindcast dataset independent of training along with altimeter observations. The result of good consistency in terms of a root mean square error of 0.32 m (under sea state conditions of approximately 0.5-7.0 m) outperforms the existing Gaofen-3 wave height retrieval algorithms. Additionally, this paper introduces a discussion about the contribution of polarizations by comparing SWH derived from single-, dual-and quad-polarized deep convolutional neural networks. Single-polarized Gaofen-3 SAR data are found to be sufficient to provide accurate estimates compared to quad-polarization via a deep learning model under moderate sea conditions.

In recent years, data-driven deep learningbased land-use mapping methods have made great breakthroughs due to their strong feature extraction ability. Meanwhile, multisource geographic data, such as open street map (OSM), has been applied in land-use mapping with high spatial resolution remote sensing (HSR) imagery. Nevertheless, given the intraclass visual inconsistency and interclass label ambiguity, there are enormous challenges in OSM-based land-use pattern depiction: 1) the significant size variability of land-use parcel generated by OSM; 2) the weak interpretability of the datadriven based features; and 3) the neglect of intrinsically hierarchical and nested relationships between landcover and land-use. In this paper, to bridge the \"knowledge gap\" for urban land-use mapping, a knowledgeguided land pattern depicting (KGLPD) framework is proposed. The proposed KGLPD framework mainly contains four parts. Land-use parcels with various scales are generated based on OSM. An adaptive gradient perceptive (AGP) mechanism is proposed to provide patch distribution prior knowledge for guiding the datadriven based visual feature extraction. To effectively cognize the layout of different land-cover types as the knowledge-driven information, a land pattern cognitive (LPC) model is designed to capture the inner and outer relationships (i.e., direction, distance and co-frequency) of different land-cover types. The fully sparse topic model (FSTM) is then used to extract the critical land pattern information from the data-driven and knowledgedriven information. Four typical Chinese urban cities are selected to evaluate the proposed framework. Experimental results on three cities with four regions of distinctive characteristics in different years, have achieved high classification accuracies of about 80%, with 10% improvement compared with other methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed knowledge-guided urban land use mapping framework. Experimental results on the whole city of Shenzhen in China imply that the proposed framework perform well with small training samples. The results on different cities validate the generalizability and transferability of KGLPD. The typical land-use maps and the corresponding land-cover maps help understanding the relationship between them.', '[Zhu, Qiqi; Lei, Yang; Guan, Qingfeng] China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

However, it has not yet been comprehensively evaluated using data from different sources, and its ability to model reflectance spectra needs to be further explored. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a tangible parametric model of soil hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance via the evaluation and extension of the Hapke model (hereafter named the Hapke-HSR model). Comprehensive directional and spectral soil reflectance datasets, including satellite, field data, two spectral libraries, and simulated reflectance spectra, were used. First, the two widely used versions of the Hapke model, namely, the SOILSPECT and original Hapke models, were compared. Thereafter, the simplified SOILSPECT model was extended to characterize soil hyperspectral reflectance by deriving an approximate relationship between the single-scattering albedo and wavelength. We obtained the following results. (1) Both versions of the Hapke model agreed well in fitting soil bidirectional reflectance data. However, the SOILSPECT model (R-2 = 0.983-0.997, RMSE = 0.007-0.014) performed better than the original Hapke model (R-2 = 0.800-0.988, RMSE = 0.014-0.057) when both satellite and field data were used. (2) The Hapke-HSR model could effectively capture the characteristics of the soil hyperspectral reflectance (R-2 = 0.963-0.983 and RMSE = 0.018-0.028) based on both spectral libraries. The simulated reflectance spectra showed that the Hapke-HSR model can capture the soil moisture content variations (R-2 = 0.987, RMSE = 0.011). In addition, the residual prediction deviation (RPD) values of the Hapke-HSR model were greater than 3, indicating a high prediction accuracy. These findings demonstrate that the Hapke-HSR model performs well with respect to the characterization of soil hyperspectral directional reflectance.', '[Ding, Anxin; Ma, Han; He, Tao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

However, the accuracy of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) estimation is greatly challenged by three issues. Namely, less attention has been given to city-based global studies, LSUHII (SUHII difference) is induced when various methods are used to the determine background reference, and uncertainty arises in the methods for coping with missing land surface temperature (LST). Thus, this paper quantitatively evaluated these different methods and their impacts on spatiotemporal SUHII variations across 1112 global cities. There are two major findings: (1) the modified equal area-rural (MEA-R) method can overcome the limitations of the other methods. The fixed buffer (FB) method is limited by the difficulty of buffer selection and the inapplicability of a single fixed buffer for various cities, particularly in large-scale studies. The simplified urban-extent (SUE) method is challenged by cluster discrepancies and data obsolescence issues, and the modified equal area-suburban (MEA-S) method underestimates SUHII resulting from strong human activities in suburban areas. The daytime LSUHII induced by different methods for the reference definition reaches 0.62 K, accounting for 42% of the average SUHII. LSUHII is 0.34 K (23%) at night. LSUHII with evident spatiotemporal variations indicates that the different methods used to define the background reference introduce a considerable uncertainty to SUHII research. (2) After comparing methods for coping with missing LST, the first spatial and after temporal aggregation with threshold removal (FSAT-T) method is demonstrated to provided improved robustness to data missing over other methods. Daytime LSUHII is over 0.1 K in 62% of cities, and nighttime LSUHII is over 0.1 K in 45% of cities. Strong latitudinal and seasonal variations of LSUHII induced by the different methods used to cope with missing data introduce uncertainty and incomparability to SUHII research. Moreover, various image quality control (QC) methods and the effects from these methods on SUHII are discussed. The accuracy of QC methods changes with the error distribution of the image quality. Further investigations are required to determine the optimal QC method. The questions of whether different background definition affects the atmospheric UHI were also discussed. In this paper, a promising strategy for estimating city-based SUHII is proposed and a global-scale database based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) is established to support further research on the variations and controls of SUHI.', '[Li, Kangning; Chen, Yunhao; Gao, Shengjun] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.', 'Beijing Normal UniversityRP Chen, YH (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.', 'cyh@bnu.edu.cn', NULL, 'National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171316]; Projects of   Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Urban Design, Beijing   University of Civil Engineering and Architecture [UDC2019031321];   Beijing Laboratory of Water Resources Security; Beijing Key Laboratory   of Environmental Remote Sensing and Digital Cities', 'This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundationof   China (42171316) , Projects of Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for   Future Urban Design, Beijing University of Civil Engineering and   Architecture (UDC2019031321) , and in part by the Beijing Laboratory of   Water Resources Security and Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental   Remote Sensing and Digital Cities.

In contrast to general drying trends in global endorheic basins in recent decades, the widespread lake expansions across the endorheic TP stand out as a puzzling \"anomaly\". To quantify the contribution of glacier mass changes to lake expansion at fine basin-scale details, we compute spatially resolved estimation of mass change in both glaciers and lakes across the endorheic TP between 2000 and 2010/14 based on multi-mission remote sensing observations. Our glacier mass balance estimates were based on the differences between the newly released global TanDEM-X DEM and the historical SRTM-C DEM, which provide nearly complete coverage (98%) of the glacierized area on the endorheic TP. We provide lake water storage changes of all lakes 1 km(2) on the inner TP. These estimates reveal that the massive lake water increase (9.44 +/- 1.43 Gt yr(-1)) was essentially not from the mass loss of glaciers which represents only about 4.7 +/- 8.8% of the lake water change (0.44 +/- 0.80 Gt yr(-1)). The relationship in individual basins was, however, highly heterogeneous. About 20% of total lake storage gain had no causality with glacier feeding. In comparison, for 28% of lake water surplus, mainly in the northwestern TP, the positive glacier mass balance infers that glaciers retained some precipitation surplus that could otherwise have been drained to downstream lakes. For the other 52% of lake storage gain, mostly in southern and eastern regions, the glacier mass loss varied among the basins with limited contributing levels (mostly <20%). Our analyses highlight remarkable spatial and temporal variabilities in lake/glacier changes on the endoreic TP and contribute to a better understanding of the role of glaciers in the recent Tibetan lake growth and the impact of climate change on the two types of water reserves.', '[Ke, Linghong; Yong, Bin] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.

A variety of algorithms have been developed to estimate phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) from satellite ocean color data.

In this study, several existing PSC models were applied in the Northeast U.S. continental shelf (NES) region and compared with in situ PSC estimates derived from a local HPLC pigment data set. The effect of regional re-parameterization and incorporation of sea surface temperature (SST) into existing abundance-based model frameworks was investigated and model performance was assessed using an independent data set. Abundance-based model re-parameterization alone did not result in significant improvement in model performance compared with other models. However, the inclusion of SST led to a consistent reduction in model error for all size classes. Of two absorption-based algorithms tested, the best performing approach displayed similar performance metrics to the regional SST-dependent abundance-based model. The SST-dependent model and the absorption-based method were applied to monthly composites of the NES region for April and September 2019 and qualitatively compared.

Canopy height estimates from current satellite missions such as ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) offer promise to close this knowledge gap, but their validation is critically important to inform their measurement uncertainties and scientific utility. Using existing airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, the agreement of a variety of terrain and aboveground canopy height metrics including summary height statistics and percentiles, from ICESat-2\' Land, Water and Vegetation Elevation product (ATL08) product was assessed in 12 sites across six major biomes in the United States. The agreement between ATL08 and ALS heights was assessed using the mean bias (Bias, ATL08 - ALS), the mean absolute error (MAE) and their percent equivalents, percent bias (pBias) and percent MAE (pMAE), respectively. In general, the agreement between ATL08 and ALS terrain heights was high (Bias 0.18 m, pBias 0.1%) while canopy heights showed lower agreement (Bias -1.71 m, pBias -15.9%). Analyses by biome, time of acquisition and beam strength of the ICESat-2 photon data also showed generally higher agreement for ATL08 terrain than canopy heights. Analyses also showed the performance of ATL08 heights varied with canopy cover with ATL08 terrain heights showing the best agreement when canopy cover was between 40 and 70% while the best performance for ATL08 canopy heights was observed when canopy cover was greater than 80%. This observation, coupled with analyses by biome, indicate that ATL08 canopy heights are more suitable in relatively dense canopy environments such as conifer and broadleaf forests than relatively sparse environments such a temperate grassland and Savannas. Higher level canopy height percentiles (95th and 98th) showed higher agreement (mean Bias 12.5%) with ALS heights than lower percentiles (minimum, 25th, mean pBias similar to 39.2%). These findings indicate that ATL08 canopy heights show more promise for routine canopy height characterization using the 95th and 98% percentiles but is limited in characterizing intermediate vertical structure. The observed performance differences between ATL08 terrain and canopy heights are attributed to differences in photon sampling rates over terrain and canopy surfaces which, compounded with background noise in ICESat-2 photon data, led to different effectiveness for ATL08 processing routines in filtering terrain and off-terrain points. This assessment of the impact of a variety of factors provides the vegetation community with an understanding of the capabilities and limitations of height estimates from the ICESat-2 ATL08 product.', '[Malambo, Lonesome; Popescu, Sorin C.] Texas A&M Univ, Ecol & Conservat Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.', 'Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College StationRP Malambo, L (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Ecol & Conservat Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.', 'mmoonga@tamu.edu; Sorin.Popescu@ag.tamu.eduRI Popescu, Sorin C/D-5981-2015', 'Popescu, Sorin C/0000-0002-8155-8801', 'NASA ICESat-2 Science Team, Studies with ICESat-2 grant [NNH19ZDA001N]', 'This research was funded by NASA ICESat-2 Science Team, Studies with   ICESat-2 NNH19ZDA001N grant.', 42, 33, 33, 10, 59, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The detection of vitality loss at an early stage is thus of vital importance for forestry and forest management to minimize ecological and economical damage. Remote sensing instruments are able to detect changes over large areas down to the level of individual trees. The scope of our study is to investigate whether it is possible to detect stress-related spectral changes at an early stage using hyperspectral sensors. For this purpose, two Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest stands, both different in age and maintenance, were monitored in the field over two vegetation periods. In parallel, time series of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data were acquired. For each stand 70 trees were artificially stressed (ring-barked) and 70 trees were used as control trees. The data collected in south-eastern Germany consists of measurements at multiple times and at different scales: (1) crown conditions were visually assessed in the field (2) needle reflectance spectra were acquired in the laboratory using a FieldSpec spectrometer, and (3) hyperspectral airborne data (HySpex) were flown at 0.5 m spatial resolution. We aimed for a simultaneous data acquisition at the three levels. This unique data set was investigated whether any feature can be discriminated to detect vitality loss in trees at an early stage. Several spectral transformations were applied to the needle and tree crown spectra, such as spectral derivatives, vegetation indices and angle indices. All features were examined for their separability (ring-barked vs. control trees) with the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm. As result, the younger, well maintained forest stand only showed minor changes over the 2-year period, whereas changes in the older forest stand were observable both in the needle and in the hyperspectral tree crown spectra, respectively. These changes could even be detected before changes were visible by field observations. The tree spectral reactions to ring-barking were first noticeable 11 months after ring-barking and 6 weeks before they were visible by field inspection. The most discriminative features for separating the two groups were the reflectance spectra and the spectral derivatives, over the VIs or angle indices. The tree crown spectra of the two groups could be separated by the RF classifier with a 79% overall accuracy at the beginning of the second vegetation period and 1 month later with 92% overall accuracy with high kappa index. The results clearly demonstrate the great potential of hyperspectral remote sensing in detecting early vitality changes of stressed trees.', '[Einzmann, Kathrin; Atzberger, Clement; Glas, Christina; Boeck, Sebastian; Immitzer, Markus] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Geomat, Vienna BOKU, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.

A significant shortcoming complicating their usage in quantitative remote sensing applications is insufficient robust radiometric calibration methods. In a direct reflectance transformation method, the drone is equipped with a camera and an irradiance sensor, allowing transformation of image pixel values to reflectance factors without ground reference data. This method requires the sensors to be calibrated with higher accuracy than what is usually required by the empirical line method (ELM), but consequently it offers benefits in robustness, ease of operation, and ability to be used on Beyond-Visual Line of Sight flights. The objective of this study was to develop and assess a drone-based workflow for direct reflectance transformation and implement it on our hyperspectral remote sensing system. A novel atmospheric correction method is also introduced, using two reference panels, but, unlike in the ELM, the correction is not directly affected by changes in the illumination. The sensor system consists of a hyperspectral camera (Rikola HSI, by Senop) and an onboard irradiance spectrometer (FGI AIRS), which were both given thorough radiometric calibrations. In laboratory tests and in a flight experiment, the FGI AIRS tilt-corrected irradiances had accuracy better than 1.9% at solar zenith angles up to 70 degrees. The system\'s low-altitude reflectance factor accuracy was assessed in a flight experiment using reflectance reference panels, where the normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) were less than +/- 2% for the light panels (25% and 50%) and less than +/- 4% for the dark panels (5% and 10%). In the high-altitude images, taken at 100-150 m altitude, the NRMSEs without atmospheric correction were within 1.4%-8.7% for VIS bands and 2.0%-18.5% for NIR bands. Significant atmospheric effects appeared already at 50 m flight altitude. The proposed atmospheric correction was found to be practical and it decreased the high-altitude NRMSEs to 1.3%-2.6% for VIS bands and to 2.3%5.3% for NIR bands. Overall, the workflow was found to be efficient and to provide similar accuracies as the ELM, but providing operational advantages in such challenging scenarios as in forest monitoring, large-scale autonomous mapping tasks, and real-time applications. Tests in varying illumination conditions showed that the reflectance factors of the gravel and vegetation targets varied up to 8% between sunny and cloudy conditions due to reflectance anisotropy effects, while the direct reflectance workflow had better accuracy. This suggests that the varying illumination conditions have to be further accounted for in drone-based in quantitative remote sensing applications.', '[Suomalainen, Juha; Oliveira, Raquel A.; Hakala, Teemu; Koivumaki, Niko; Markelin, Lauri; Nasi, Roope; Honkavaara, Eija] Natl Land Survey Finland, Dept Remote Sensing & Photogrammetry, Finnish Geospatial Res Inst, Helsinki, Finland.', 'The National Land Survey of Finland; Finnish Geospatial Research   Institute (FGI)RP Suomalainen, J (通讯作者)，Natl Land Survey Finland, Dept Remote Sensing & Photogrammetry, Finnish Geospatial Res Inst FGI, POB 84, FI-00521 Helsinki, Finland.', 'juha.suomalainen@nls.fi; raquel.alvesdeoliveira@nls.fi;   teemu.hakala@nls.fi; niko.koivumaki@nls.fi; lauri.markelin@nls.fi;   roope.nasi@nls.fi; eija.honkavaara@nls.fiRI Markelin, Lauri/AAB-9892-2022; Markelin, Lauri/AAY-6980-2021; de   Oliveira, Raquel Alves/AAM-2284-2020', 'Markelin, Lauri/0000-0002-1570-4196; Nasi, Roope/0000-0002-5823-8180', 'Metrology for Earth Observation and Climate project (MetEOC-3) within   the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research (EMPIR)   [16ENV03]; Academy of Finland [327861]; European Union; Academy of   Finland (AKA) [327861, 327861] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)', 'The research leading to these results was funded through the Metrology   for Earth Observation and Climate project (MetEOC-3), grant number   16ENV03 within the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and   Research (EMPIR) and through the Academy of Finland project \"Autonomous   tree health analyzer based on imaging UAV spectrometry (Aspect)\"   (Decision number 327861).

To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel LST retrieval method based on model-data-knowledge-driven and deep learning, called the MDK-DL method. Based on the expert knowledge and radiation transfer model, we deduce LST retrieval mechanism and determine the best combination of the thermal infrared (TIR) bands of the sensor. Then, we use the radiation transfer model simulation and reliable satellite-ground data to establish a training and test database, and finally use the deep learning neural network for optimal computation. Three typical high-, medium- and low-spatial-resolution TIR remote sensing datasets (from Gaofen, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Fengyun) are used for theoretical simulation and application analysis. The simulation shows that the minimum mean absolute error (MAE) is less than 0.1 K (standard deviation: 0.04 K; correlation coefficient: 1.000) at a small viewing direction (<7.5 degrees) and less than 0.8 K at a large viewing direction (<65 degrees). The in situ validation shows that the minimum MAE obtained by the optimal band combination is approximately 1 K (root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.12 K; coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.902). The retrieval accuracy is improved by increasing the number of TIR bands in the atmospheric window, and adding accurate atmospheric water vapor information produces better results. In general, four TIR bands in the atmospheric window bands are sufficient to retrieve the LST with high accuracy. Likewise, three TIR bands plus atmospheric water vapor information are sufficient for the retrieval requirements. All analyses indicate that our method is feasible and reliably accurate and can also be used to help design the instrument band to retrieve the LST with high precision.', '[Wang, Han; Mao, Kebiao; Yuan, Zijin; Cao, Mengmeng; Qin, Zhihao; Duan, Sibo] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.

To investigate the potential of SWOT in recovering high-quality marine gravity and how SWOT observation errors should be treated to optimize the accuracy of gravity anomaly from SWOT observations, we create high-wavenumber SSH components from multi-beam depths in the northern South China Sea (SCS) and simulate SWOT SSH errors. To cross-validate gravity signals and avoid gravity errors from SWOT, we use two computational methods (inverse Vening-Meinesz formula, IVM and inverse Stokes\' integral, ISM) and recommend separate optimal data processing strategies when using geoid gradients (GGs) and geoid heights (GHs) for gravity recovery. The use of GGs (for IVM) effectively eliminates systematic errors in gravity derivation. If GHs (for ISM) are used in gravity recovery, the tilt in wide-swath SSHs should be removed before gravity computation, and the recovered gravity must be filtered (post-processed) to avoid artificial gravity signals due to the SSH errors. Our assessments using mgal-accuracy shipborne gravity anomalies in the northern SCS show that multiple-cycle SWOT observations can deliver high-quality marine gravity anomalies. IVM is more robust than ISM in resisting random and systematic errors in SWOT.

High-resolution optical satellite images can provide fine spatial details within urban areas, while they have not been applied to building height estimation over multiple cities and the feasibility of mapping building height at a fine scale (< 5 m) remains understudied. Multi-view satellite images can describe vertical information of buildings, due to the inconsistent response of buildings (e.g., spectral and structural variations) to different viewing angles, but they have not been employed to deep learning-based building height estimation. In this context, we introduce high-resolution ZY-3 multi-view images to estimate building height at a spatial resolution of 2.5 m. We propose a multi-spectral, multi-view, and multi-task deep network (called M(3)Net) for building height estimation, where ZY-3 multi-spectral and multi-view images are fused in a multi-task learning framework. A random forest (RF) method using multi-source features is also carried out for comparison. We select 42 Chinese cities with diverse building types to test the proposed method. Results show that the M(3)Net obtains a lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the RF, and the inclusion of ZY-3 multi-view images can significantly lower the uncertainty of building height prediction. Comparison with two existing state-of-the-art studies further confirms the superiority of our method, especially the efficacy of the M(3)Net in alleviating the saturation effect of high-rise building height estimation. Compared to the vanilla single/multi-task models, the M(3)Net also achieves a lower RMSE. Moreover, the spatial-temporal transferability test indicates the robustness of the M(3)Net to imaging conditions and building styles. The test of our method on a relatively large area (covering about 14,120 km(2)) further validates the scalability of our method from the perspectives of both efficacy and quality.

While multiple algorithmic techniques and refinements have been proposed, the greenhouse gas target spectrum used for concentration enhancement estimation has remained largely unaltered since the introduction of quantitative matched filter retrievals. The magnitude of retrieved methane and carbon dioxide enhancements, and thereby integrated mass enhancements (IME) and estimated flux of point-source emitters, is heavily dependent on this target spectrum. Current standard use of molecular absorption coefficients to create unit enhancement target spectra does not account for absorption by background concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar and sensor geometry, or atmospheric water vapor absorption. We introduce geometric and atmospheric parameters into the generation of scene-specific unit enhancement spectra to provide target spectra that are compatible with all greenhouse gas retrieval matched filter techniques. Specifically, we use radiative transfer modeling to model four parameters that are expected to change between scenes: solar zenith angle, column water vapor, ground elevation, and sensor altitude. These parameter values are well defined, with low variation within a single scene. A benchmark dataset consisting of ten AVIRIS-NG airborne imaging spectrometer scenes was used to compare IME retrieved using a matched filter algorithm. For methane plumes, IME resulting from use of standard, generic enhancement spectra varied from -22 to +28.7% compared to scene-specific enhancement spectra. Due to differences in spectral shape between the generic and scenespecific enhancement spectra, differences in methane plume IME were linked to surface spectral characteristics in addition to geometric and atmospheric parameters. IME differences were much larger for carbon dioxide plumes, with generic enhancement spectra producing integrated mass enhancements -76.1 to -48.1% compared to scene-specific enhancement spectra. Fluxes calculated from these integrated enhancements would vary by the same percentages, assuming equivalent wind conditions. Methane and carbon dioxide IME were most sensitive to changes in solar zenith angle and ground elevation. We introduce an interpolation approach that can efficiently generate scene-specific unit enhancement spectra for given sets of parameters. Scene-specific target spectra can improve confidence in greenhouse gas retrievals and flux estimates across collections of scenes with diverse geometric and atmospheric conditions.', '[Foote, Markus D.; Joshi, Sarang C.] Univ Utah, Sci Comp & Imaging Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.

As such, it is important to improve our understanding of how climate and anthropogenic activities impact land water storage. Previous studies using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data have struggled to effectively separate the impacts of climate variability and human activities on water storage. Here, we propose a statistical model that simulates natural dynamically driven changes in water storage to reconstruct climate-driven water storage anomalies at basin scales and discuss the possibility of differentiating climate- and human-driven water storage anomalies. The prediction and reconstruction performance of this method shows optimal robustness. Compared with water storage anomalies calculated using land surface models, our reconstruction results are closer to GRACE observations, especially in humid basins with few human interventions. Mismatches are found in basins with intensive human interventions. Isolated human-driven water storage anomalies in four representative basins correlate well with anthropogenic water usage in each basin. The results of this study provide a method to effectively separate and monitor climate- and human-driven water storage anomalies, thereby providing information for better protection and utilization of water resources.', '[Liu, Bingshi; Zou, Xiancai; Li, Jiancheng] Wuhan Univ, Sch Geodesy & Geomat, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

However, there are still inter-sensor inconsistencies of surface reflectance caused by differences in sensor spectral response and residuals in calibration and atmospheric correction. Such inconsistencies tend to entangle with the land surface change, especially for the subtle changes such as vegetation responses to climate change. We propose a Bayesian approach to reduce inter-sensor inconsistencies by making Landsat 5, 7 and 8 reflectance consistent with MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR). The Bayesian MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance should be similar to the MODIS NBAR when it is degraded to the MODIS resolution considering the point spread function (PSF). The MODIS NBAR PSF is modelled as a Gaussian function with empirically derived and band specific parameters. The relationships between the MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance and the two available reflectance (i.e., the MODIS NBAR and observed Landsat reflectance) are built in the Bayesian framework. The Bayesian MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance is then derived using the computationally efficient conjugate gradient descent method. The algorithm was applied to Landsat 5, 7 and 8 surface reflectance over five study areas in Brazil, China, France, Russia and USA, and compared with a linear regression-based reflectance adjustment method. Visual difference was evident in the MODIS NBAR and the observed Landsat reflectance and the relative root-mean-squared differences (rRMSD) ranged from 3.16% to 67.72% and R2 from 0.037 to 0.934. Both the Bayesian and linearly MODISconsistent Landsat reflectance are visually more consistent with the MODIS NBAR.

The linear regression derived using the whole image pixels has low performance in adjusting some extreme reflectance values that are not well represented in the image.

RO present specific architecture and optical properties as compared to leaves and stems, which may impact canopy reflectance. This study aims to understand and quantify the influence of RO on the bi-directional variation of canopy reflectance and NDVI. Multispectral camera observations from a UAV were completed over wheat, maize, and sunflower just after flowering when the RO are fully developed and the leaf layer with only marginal senescence. The flights were designed to sample the BRDF with view zenith angles spanning from nadir to 60?and many compass directions. Three flights corresponding to three sun positions were completed under clear sly conditions. The camera was always pointing to two adjacent plots of few tenths of square meters: the RO were manually removed on one plot, while the other plot was kept undisturbed. Results showed that the three visible bands (450 nm, 570 nm, 675 nm), and in a lesser way the red edge band (730 nm) were strongly correlated. We, therefore, focused on the 675 nm and 850 nm bands. The Bi-Directional Reflectance (BRF) of the canopy without RO shows that the BRF values were almost symmetrical across the principal plane, even for maize and sunflower canopies with a strong row structure. Examination of the BRF difference between the canopy with and without RO indicate that the RO impact canopy BRDF for the three crops. The magnitude of the impacts depends on crop, wavelength and observational geometry. These observations are generally consistent with realistic 3D reflectance simulations. However, some discrepancies were noticed, mainly explained by the small magnitude of the RO effect on canopy BRF, and the approximations made when simulating the RO layer and its coupling with the bottom canopy layer. We finally demonstrated that the RO layer impact the estimates of canopy traits such as GAI as derived from the multispectral observations.', '[Li, Wenjuan; Jiang, Jingyi; Weiss, Marie; Madec, Simon; Tison, Franck; Baret, Frederic] Avignon Univ, INRAE, UMR EMMAH, F-84000 Avignon, France.

Here we leverage 4.5+ years of satellite-based radar and optical remote sensing data to quantify the kinematics of a slow-moving landslide in the tropical rural environment of the Kivu Rift, with unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution. We measure landslide motion using sub-pixel image correlation methods and invert these data into dense time series that capture weekly to multi-year changes in landslide kinematics. We cross-validate and compare our satellite-based results with very-high-resolution Unoccupied Aircraft System topographic datasets, and explore how rainfall, simulated pore-water pressure, and nearby earthquakes control the overall landslide behaviour. The landslide exhibited seasonal and multi-year velocity variations that varied across the landslide kinematic units. While rainfall-induced changes in pore-water pressure exerts a primary control on the landslide motion, these alone cannot explain the observed variability in landslide behaviour. We suggest instead that the observed landslide kinematics result from internal landslide dynamics, such as extension, compression, material redistribution, and interactions within and between kinematic units. Our study provides, a rare, detailed overview of the deformation pattern of a landslide located in a tropical environment. In addition, our work highlights the viability of sub-pixel image correlation with long time series of radar-amplitude data to quantify surface deformation in tropical environments where optical data is limited by persistent cloud cover and emphasize the importance of exploiting synergies between multiple types of data to capture the complex kinematic pattern of landslides.', '[Dille, Antoine; Kervyn, Francois; Bibentyo, Toussaint Mugaruka; Dewitte, Olivier] Royal Museum Cent Africa, Dept Earth Sci, Tervuren, Belgium.

The resulting land subsidence often combines with ground faulting/fracturing and damage to infrastructure. This study provides the longest Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) survey ever undertaken for the Aguascalientes Valley, aimed to constrain its structurally-controlled subsidence process and the induced risk. 275 ERS-1/2 1996-2002, ENVISAT 2003-2010 and Sentinel-1 2014-2020 C-band SAR images are processed with change detection, differential Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) methods. Aguascalientes notably expanded over the last four decades, as revealed by Seasat 1978 L-band SAR, Landsat 1985-2010 and Sentinel-2 2020 optical imagery. The observed subsidence pattern involves alluvial/fluvial deposits within the N-S trending graben. Maximum settlement rates are -14 cm/year in 1996, -10 cm/year in 2000-2010 and over -12 cm/year in 2015-2020. An acceleration (-0.70 cm/year(2)) is recorded in 2015-2020 close to recently developed industrial plants and housing districts. Satellite estimates agree with in-situ observations, static GPS surveying and continuous GPS monitoring data. Rough correlation is found with piezometric level drop rates, whereas aquifer thickness plays a stronger role in the subsidence process. While these outcomes align with the existing literature, this InSAR survey: (i) unveils previously unknown E-W deformation affecting two N-S oriented bands within the valley, with up to similar to +/- 3 cm/year in 2015-2020 towards its center; (ii) identifies zones of sagging and hogging with horizontal strain (epsilon) of up to 0.05-0.1%; (iii) retrieves differential rates reaching 6-8 cm/year and angular distortions (beta) of 1/500 along the Oriente fault; and (iv) investigates the statistical distribution of, beta across field surveyed faults and fissures, and marks areas with potentially yetunmapped ground discontinuities. A new surface faulting risk matrix embedding beta and epsilon is therefore proposed to estimate subsidence impact on properties and population. Given its scale-dependency, the risk assessment provides a lower bound to the percentage of urban areas at risk within the Aguascalientes state: at least 2% of the urban areas were at high and very high risk in 2003-2010 (involving similar to 12,000 properties and similar to 39,000 inhabitants), but this increased to 6% in 2015-2020 (similar to 25,600 properties, similar to 85,200 inhabitants).

High inter-annual variability in the phenology of vegetation and in the seasonality of temperature pose a threat for biodiversity. However, areas with high spatial variability likely have higher ecological resilience where inter-annual variability is high, because spatial variability indicates presence of a range of resources, microclimatic refugia, and habitat conditions. The integration of inter-annual and spatial variability is thus important for biodiversity conservation. Areas where spatial variability is low and inter-annual variability is high are likely to limit resilience to disturbance. In contrast, areas of high spatial variability may be high priority candidates for protection. Our goal was to develop spatiotemporal remotely sensed indices to identify hotspots of biodiversity conservation concern. We generated indices that capture the inter-annual and spatial variability of vegetation greenness and land surface temperature and integrated them to identify areas of high, medium, and low biodiversity conservation concern. We applied our method in Argentina (2.8 million km(2)), a country with a wide range of climates and biomes. To generate the inter-annual variability indices, we analyzed MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) time series from 2001 to 2018, fitted curves to obtain annual phenological and seasonal metrics, and calculated their inter-annual variability. To generate the spatial variability indices, we calculated standard deviation image texture of Landsat 8 EVI and LST. When we integrated our inter-annual and spatial variability indices, areas in the northeast and parts of southern Argentina were the hotspots of highest conservation concern. High inter-annual variability poses a threat in these areas, because spatial variability is low. These are areas where management efforts could be valuable. In contrast, areas in the northwest and central-west are where protection should be strongly considered because the high spatial variability may confer resilience to disturbance, due to the variety of conditions and resources within close proximity. We developed remotely sensed indices to identify hotspots of high and low conservation concern at scales relevant to biodiversity conservation, = which can be used to target management actions in order to minimize biodiversity loss.', '[Silveira, Eduarda M.

Among different kinds of spectral unmixing models, the linear mixture model (LMM) has been widely applied with its simplicity in light scattering mechanisms and flexibility in different scenarios. Recently, a variety of optimized LMMs have been developed to enhance the decomposing ability. However, two major challenges still exist: endmember variability and global optimum solution with the inequality constraint. In this study, aiming to avoid the influence of endmember variability and to extend the application of LMM, a novel inequality-constrained weighted linear mixture model (IWLMM) is proposed. Based on the errors-in-variables (EIV) model and the theory of weighted total least squares (WTLS), the issue of endmember variability and stochastic errors of both endmembers and mixed pixels are eliminated. With the non-negativity constraint, a brief optimal algorithm to solve the IWLMM is generated as well. In order to indicate the advantages of proposed IWLMM, comparative experiments with the conventional fully constrained least squares (FCLS), three currently proposed LMM-based models (perturbed LMM (PLMM), extended LMM (ELMM) and augmented LMM (ALMM)) and three physics-based nonlinear mixture models (bilinear-Fan model (BFM), generalized bilinear model (GBM) and polynomial post-nonlinear model (PPNM)) on four synthetic and real scenarios with hyperspectral and multispectral datasets were performed. The experimental results suggest the IWLMM outperforms the other seven linear and nonlinear unmixing models after adding the correction for endmember variability by modeling the perturbation and scaling factors of spectral features simultaneously.

Snow cover data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra satellites can capture these dynamics over large spatiotemporal scales, allowing for the development of indices with specific application in ecological research and predicting biodiversity. Here, our primary objective was to derive winter habitat indices (WHIs) from MODIS that quantify snow season length, snow cover variability, and the prevalence of frozen ground without snow as a proxy for subnivium conditions. We calculated the WHIs for the full snow year (Aug-Jul) and winter months (Dec-Feb) across the contiguous US from 2003/04 to 2017/18 and validated them with ground-based data from 797 meteorological stations. To demonstrate the potential of the WHIs for biodiversity assessments, we modeled their relationships with winter bird species richness derived from eBird observations. The WHIs had clear spatial patterns reflecting both altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in snow cover. Snow season length was generally longer at higher latitudes and elevations, while snow cover variability and frozen ground without snow were highest across low elevations of the mid latitudes. Variability in the WHIs was largely driven by elevation in the West and by latitude in the East. Snow season length and frozen ground without snow were most accurately mapped, and had correlations with station data across all years of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively. Snow cover variability was accurately mapped for winter (r = 0.79), but not for the full snow year (r = -0.21). The model containing all three WHIs used to predict winter bird species richness patterns across the contiguous US was by far the best, demonstrating the individual value of each index. Regions with longer snow seasons generally supported fewer species. Species richness increased steadily up to moderate levels of snow cover variability and frozen ground without snow, after which it steeply declined. Our results show that the MODIS WHIs accurately characterized unique gradients of snow cover dynamics and provided important information on winter habitat conditions for birds, highlighting their potential for ecological research and conservation planning.', '[Gudex-Cross, David; Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, SILVIS Lab, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

Soil moisture products provided by passive microwave remote sensing possess coarse spatial resolutions ranging from 25 to 50 km, unable to reflect large spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture caused by complex interactions among meteorological forcing, land cover, and topography. Meanwhile, active microwave remote sensing can provide higher spatial resolution than passive sensors that may reach 1 km but with lower temporal resolution of 6-12 days (e.g., Sentinel-1). Better water resources management, particularly for the agricultural sector, requires spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture estimates at the field scale (e.g., 30 m x 30 m) to reflect its high spatiotemporal variability across heterogeneous land surfaces. In this study, both data fusion and random forest models along with a range of remote sensing, reanalysis, and in situ data were jointly used to generate spatiotemporally continuous surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m x 30 m. First, both daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface albedo at 30 m x 30 m were generated by fusing reflectance products of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat. Second, China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) land surface temperature (LST) was fused with both MODIS LST and Landsat LST to generate spatially complete LST maps (at 11 a.m. local solar time for each day) at 30 m x 30 m. Last, random forest models were developed to generate spatiotemporally continuous SSM of 30 m x 30 m using the fused variables at fine spatial resolution (e. g., NDVI, surface albedo, and LST), SSM background fields, and ancillary variables such as precipitation and soil texture as the model inputs. Compared with original SSM of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Version 4.4 SSM, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-4 SSM, and CLDAS SSM, the downscaled SSM using these products as background fields was improved significantly in terms of accuracy and spatial distribution. Moreover, the integration of multiple SSM background fields improved the performance of the downscaled SSM significantly in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and accuracy compared with that using a single SSM background field. Overall, the downscaled SMAP_L4 + CLDAS SSM showed the best performance at four sites (i.e., Weishan, Huailai, Hujiatan, and Paihuai) out of seven sites on the North China Plain with R, bias, MAE, RMSE, and ubRMSE ranging from 0.70-0.84, -0.034-0.012 cm (3)/cm(3), 0.025-0.044 cm(3)/cm(3), 0.031-0.050 cm(3)/cm(3), and 0.022-0.042 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed framework maximizes the potential of data fusion, random forest models, and in situ data in deriving spatiotemporally continuous SSM estimates at 30 m x 30 m, which should be valuable for water resources management at the field scale.', '[Abowarda, Ahmed Samir; Bai, Liangliang; Zhang, Caijin; Long, Di; Li, Xueying; Huang, Qi; Sun, Zhangli] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.', 'Tsinghua UniversityRP Bai, LL; Long, D (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.', 'bll306@126.com; dlong@tsinghua.edu.cnRI Long, Di/N-8049-2013; Samir, Ahmed/CAH-6140-2022; SUN,   Zhangli/G-3494-2017', 'Long, Di/0000-0001-9033-5039; SUN, Zhangli/0000-0002-1000-1029', 'Major Science and Technology Projects of Inner Mongolia Autonomous   Region [2020ZD0009]; National Key Research and Development Program of   China [2017YFC0405801]; National Natural Science Foundation of China   [51722903, 52079065]; Beijing Outstanding Young Scientist Program   [BJJWZYJH01201910028032]', 'We thank Dr. Lian He from Sun Yat-Sen University for his comments on   improving the presentation of this manuscript.

Recent research interest and rapid growth of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) technology principally due to its low cost and timeliness, is providing high-spatial resolution data for enhancing forest inventories and forest dynamics monitoring. The increasing prevalence of these UAV acquired datasets in forestry promotes a need for better understanding of how DAP-based point clouds change over time, and how these changes may relate to changes in forest structure. In this study, we utilized bi-temporal DAP data to investigate changes in forest structure over a 3-year period in subtropical planted forest stands throughout Dongtai Yellow Sea National Forest Park, Jiangsu Province, China. To do so, we evaluated both direct (i.e., structural parameter changes estimated using the differences between bi-temporal DAP metrics) and indirect (i. e., structural parameters were modelled for each date, and their changes predicted as their differences) methods to estimate the changes in forest structure. In addition, once models were developed, changes in Lorey\'s mean height and volume were extrapolated across the entire study site and examined related to the forest type and age. Our assessments of the different approaches showed that the direct approach (R-2 = 0.54-0.78) resulted in improved accuracy compared to the indirect method (R-2 = 0.51-0.73). The distributional metrics, namely, height percentiles (e.g., H-75 and H-95) and canopy return density (e.g., D-7 and D-5), and the Weibull-fitted metrics (e.g., alpha) were found to be sensitive to changes in structural parameters, whereas canopy volume-related metrics had relatively low predictive capabilities. Overall, the predicted changes in Lorey\'s mean height and volume were mapped over the entire study area, and indicated that Lorey\'s mean height increased mostly in middle-aged and young forest stands. Over-mature stands showed the lowest height increment. This study proved the capability of using bi-temporal point clouds from UAV-based DAP for enhancing forest inventories and promoting sustainable forest management.', '[Fu, Xiaoyao; Zhang, Zhengnan; Cao, Lin; Liu, Hao; Shen, Xin; Wu, Xiangqian] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, 159 Longpan Rd, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

However, we cannot adequately understand, monitor or simulate tropical ecosystem responses to environmental changes without capturing the high diversity of plant functional characteristics in the species-rich tropics. Failure to do so can oversimplify our understanding of ecosystems responses to environmental disturbances. Innovative methods and data products are needed to track changes in functional trait composition in tropical forest ecosystems through time and space. This study aimed to track key functional traits by coupling Sentinel-2 derived variables with a unique data set of precisely located in-situ measurements of canopy functional traits collected from 2434 individual trees across the tropics using a standardised methodology. The functional traits and vegetation censuses were collected from 47 field plots in the countries of Australia, Brazil, Peru, Gabon, Ghana, and Malaysia, which span the four tropical continents. The spatial positions of individual trees above 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were mapped and their canopy size and shape recorded. Using geo-located tree canopy size and shape data, community-level trait values were estimated at the same spatial resolution as Sentinel-2 imagery (i.e. 10 m pixels). We then used the Geographic Random Forest (GRF) to model and predict functional traits across our plots. We demonstrate that key plant functional traits can be accurately predicted across the tropicsusing the high spatial and spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery in conjunction with climatic and soil information. Image textural parameters were found to be key components of remote sensing information for predicting functional traits across tropical forests and woody savannas. Leaf thickness ((R)2 = 0.52) obtained the highest prediction accuracy among the morphological and structural traits and leaf carbon content (R-2 = 0.70) and maximum rates of photosynthesis (R-2 = 0.67) obtained the highest prediction accuracy for leaf chemistry and photosynthesis related traits, respectively. Overall, the highest prediction accuracy was obtained for leaf chemistry and photosynthetic traits in comparison to morphological and structural traits. Our approach offers new opportunities for mapping, monitoring and understanding biodiversity and ecosystem change in the most species-rich ecosystems on Earth.', '[Aguirre-Gutierrez, Jesus; Rifal, Sami; Shenkin, Alexander; Oliveras, Imma; Girardin, Cecile A.

Spaceborne SAR Interferometry (InSAR) has the sensitivity to measure canopy height and the underlying topography. In this paper, we refine and automate an interferometric ground finding approach that exploits few look (2to 4-look) averaged interferograms and incorporates the use of a coherent electromagnetic simulator and field inventory data. Using the coherent electromagnetic simulator, an InSAR simulation based on field data is performed to study the true ground position as a function of the statistics of few-look InSAR phase heights from a model perspective. With this statistical model, both the underlying topography and the canopy height (mean and top canopy height) can be estimated. Using German Aerospace Center\'s (DLR) single-baseline single-polarization TanDEM-X InSAR data, we validate the approach over a Brazilian tropical forest (Tapajos National Forest) with both field inventory and lidar data. As validated against lidar data, the underlying topography is estimated to an accuracy of 3 m. At one hectare aggregated pixel size, InSAR phase-center height is best compared with the field/ lidar mean canopy height with an accuracy of 2-3 m, while InSAR-inverted total height best characterizes the lidar top canopy height with an accuracy of 4-5 m. Given the global data availability of TanDEM-X and the future TanDEM-L, this approach has the potential for wall-to-wall mapping of forest height as well as underlying topography and also serves as a complementary tool to other existing InSAR, Polarimetric InSAR (PolInSAR) and SAR tomography (TomoSAR) methods when only single polarization and/or baseline data are available.', '[Lei, Yang] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.

Because phenology is a sensitive indicator of the response of shrubland ecosystems to climate change, the alteration of ecosystems following species invasions, and the dynamics of shrubland ecosystem function, biodiversity, and carbon budgets, it is critical to monitor and assess phenological dynamics in shrubland ecosystems. However, most current land surface phenology (LSP) products derived from satellite data do not provide phenology detections in some semiarid shrublands where the amplitude of seasonal vegetation greenness is small. Therefore, we investigated the LSP detection using multiple spatial resolution satellite data and examined the impacts of spatial scales and shrubland ecosystem components (shrub and herb cover) on LSP detections over the western United States. Specifically, greenup onset date (GUD) in shrublands was detected from 30 m Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data and 500 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data to quantify scale effects. The GUD spatial patterns were explored with 30 m pixel variations in shrubland ecosystem components. The results show that GUD values varied with percent vegetation cover and shifted to earlier dates with increasing vegetation cover, demonstrating that satellite observations were not able to capture greenup onset until a threshold of green vegetation cover is reached. GUD was mostly undetectable from both HLS and VIIRS pixels with vegetation cover less than 10% and became fully detectable with vegetation covers larger than 50%. Similarly, the differences of GUD between HLS and VIIRS detections also decreased with increased vegetation cover. As a result of high shrubland heterogeneity, GUD from 30 m HLS pixels could be partially detected within a 500 m pixel despite GUD being undetectable from VIIRS time series. Moreover, vegetation cover heterogeneity also made it difficult for GUD at 30 m to be aggregated to coarse scales (such as to 500 m VIIRS pixels). These findings have significant implications to the detection and characterization of shrubland LSP responses to environmental and climate changes.', '[Peng, Dailiang; Wang, Yan; Huang, Wenjiang; Liu, Liangyun] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.

Here, we provide an interdisciplinary focus to explore current developments in TLS to measure and monitor forest structure. We argue that TLS data will play a critical role in understanding fundamental ecological questions about tree size and shape, allometric scaling, metabolic function and plasticity of form. Furthermore, these new developments enable new applications such as radiative transfer modelling with realistic virtual forests, monitoring of urban forests and larger scale ecosystem monitoring through long-range scanning.

High temporal and spectral resolution remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 mission enables the derivation of accurate and timely maps of tree species in forests in a cost-efficient way. However, there is still a lack of studies regarding forest stand species mapping for large areas like the Polish Carpathian Mountains (approx. 20,000 km(2)). In this study, we aimed to develop a workflow to obtain forest stand species maps with machine learning algorithms applied to multi-temporal Sentinel-2 products and environmental data at regional scale. Using variable importance techniques Variable Importance Using Random Forests (VSURF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) we assessed three Sentinel-2 Best Available Pixel composites (April, July and October), eight annual spectral-temporal metrics (STM; mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, range, first quartile, third quartile and interquartile range), and four environmental topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, distance to water bodies), i.e. 114 variables in total. Following a variable importance assessment, we produced maps of eleven tree species with the use of three Machine Learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) on nine different variable subsets, i.e. in total 27 classifications. The results showed that SVM outperformed the other two classifiers the highest overall accuracy exceeded 85% for SVM classification of all variables (86.9%), and 64 variables (85.6%). Including elevation information improved the accuracies. From the best five classifications we created a final ensemble map (overall accuracy of 86.6%) and a precision map based on the Simpson Index, which indicates where the five models agree. This ensemble approach allowed us to determine that the lowest precision occurred in foothills and basins with lower forest cover, in the areas with lack of good quality imagery, and at the borders of stands with homogenous species composition. On the other hand, the highest precision occurred in regions with homogenous stands with high forest and canopy cover. The study demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic data in mapping forest stand species in large mountainous areas with high accuracy. Furthermore, it demonstrates the usefulness of the ensemble approach, which enables to assess the classification precision.', '[Grabska, Ewa; Ostapowicz, Katarzyna] Jagiellonian Univ Krakow, Inst Geog & Spatial Management, Fac Geog & Geol, Gronostajowa 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.

The advancement in satellite remote sensing provides unprecedented opportunities for capturing CI information in a spatially continuous manner. However, challenges remain due to the lack of generalizable algorithms for accurately and efficiently mapping global CI with a fine spatial resolution. In this study, we developed a 30-m planetary-scale CI mapping framework with the reconstructed time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multiple satellite images. Using a binary crop phenophase profile indicating growing and non-growing periods, we estimated pixel-by-pixel CI by enumerating the total number of valid cropping cycles during the study years. Based on the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, we implemented the framework to estimate CI during 2016-2018 in eight geographic regions across continents that are representative of global cropping system diversity. Comparison with PhenoCam network data in four cropland sites suggests that the proposed framework is capable of capturing the seasonal dynamics of cropping practices. Spatially, overall accuracies based on validation samples range from 80.0% to 98.9% across different regions worldwide. Regarding the CI classes, single cropping systems are associated with more robust and less biased estimations than multiple cropping systems. Finally, our CI estimates reveal high agreement with two widely used land surface phenology products, including Vegetation Index and Phenology V004 (VIP4) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2), meanwhile providing much more spatial details. Due to its robustness, the developed CI framework can be potentially generalized to produce global fine resolution CI products for food security and other applications.', '[Liu, Chong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.

The study was attempted for the Vellore district, one of the worst-hit semi-regions of Tamil Nadu by salinization. The Sentinel-1 data product of C-band frequency (5.36 GHz) was instrumental in the development of the model. In the present research, a semi-empirical dielectric model was proposed, and its potential in demonstrating the rate of soil salinity was validated with in-situ measurements under semi-saturated conditions (soil moisture < 50%). The dielectric behavior of saline and non-saline soil was simulated by investigating the paradigm of the parameters, namely the backscattering coefficient of VV polarization, soil texture, and in-situ dielectric constant in the three-dimensional density space. The imaginary part of the dielectric constant was retrieved by simulating the dielectric loss from the partition observed between the dielectric constant of saline and non-saline soils in the third dimension. The resultant product of the proposed model has achieved the best fit (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 1.14, Bias = -0.65) with the in-situ EC measures of sandy soil compared to other categories of soil due to the presence of soluble salts in the free water. The proposed simulation demonstrated that the dielectric behavior of saline affected soil is dependent on soil textural characteristics under the semi-saturated condition. The simulation has shown the highest prediction performance (R-2 > 0.7) in quantifying the soil EC covered with short crops with a mean height of 0.5 m.

However, the extraction and interpretation of phenology in ecosystems with subtle growth dynamics can be challenging. US National Park Service monitoring of evergreen pinyon-juniper ecosystems in the western US revealed an unexpected winter-peaking phenological pattern in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. In this paper, we assess the validity of the winter peaks through ground-based observation of phenology and examination of solar and satellite geometry effects. To test the premise of a true vegetation response, we analyzed NDVI values extracted from a time series of ground-based digital camera (\'phenocam\') images collected September 2017 to December 2018 in a pinyon-juniper woodland in Arizona, US. Results show pinyon and juniper growth peaked in the warm season, as did the other species in the phenocam field of view. NDVI time series from four other sensors (Landsat 7, Sentinel-2, VIIRS, and Proba-V) confirmed that winter peaks in this ecosystem are not limited to MODIS products. Examination of NDVI time series (2003-2018) derived from daily 250-m MODIS data in the broader pinyon-juniper ecosystem revealed that solar-to-sensor angle, sensor zenith angle, and forward/back-scatter reflectance explained > 80% of intra-annual variability. Solar-to-sensor angle exerted the greatest control, and the direction of its correlation (positive) was the opposite of that which would be expected if it were driven by vegetation greenness. Solar-to-sensor angle is controlled seasonally by solar zenith angle and daily by variations in satellite overpass geometry. We mapped winter peaks across the western US in Google Earth Engine using 500-m MODIS MCD43A4 data, which correct for reflectance differences caused by view angle. In areas where winter vegetation peaks are ecologically improbable (i.e., locations with sub-freezing December temperatures), consistent winter peaks (>= 14 years in 2003 to 2018) are widespread in both pinyon-juniper and non-pinyon-juniper conifer ecosystems; winter peaks are common (>= 5 years in 2003 to 2018) across areas of shrubland. We attribute winter peaks to the positive correlation of NDVI with solar-to-sensor angle and solar zenith angle in combination with sparse, vertically oriented evergreen vegetation canopies. Increasing shadow visibility has been shown to increase overall NDVI, and the prevalence of the winter peaking in evergreen western sparse canopy ecosystems is consistent with this hypothesis. The extent of winter peaking patterns may have been previously overlooked due to temporal compositing, curve fitting, and incomplete snow screening.', '[Norris, Jodi R.] Natl Pk Serv, 2255 N Gemini Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA.

This parameterization scheme might affect SM retrievals in the context of vegetation disturbances, e.g., as a result of drought. By referencing the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L3 (SMOS-L3) and the SMOS-IC SM datasets, this study investigated the effects of SMAP vegetation parameterization on SMAP-reference SM differences in global land areas that are subject to differing vegetation disturbances. The results show that SMAP might underestimate SM by similar to 0.007 m(3).m(-3) for a relative NDVI decrease of 10%. The underestimation might be primarily caused by low biases in the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) surface temperature. Although using NDVI climatology might cause an overestimation of SM (due to an overestimation of vegetation effects and an underestimation of surface roughness effects), the concurrent underestimation of the GMAO surface temperature might cause an even larger underestimation of SM. The vegetation biases, particularly the surface temperature biases, should be considered for SMAP SM retrieval.

The first set includes the three orthogonal backscatter coefficients (sigma(0)(hh), sigma(0)(vv), sigma(0)(vh)) in addition to the total backscatter power (SPAN). The second set includes polarimetric decomposition parameters obtained using Cloude-Pottier and Yamaguchi decomposition methods. Data were collected during the early freezing period from 20 September until 28 December 2017. Meteorological and ice climatological data from the weather station of Resolute Bay were used to facilitate this task. Ice thickness and salinity were obtained from established empirical models. Results show that single-bounce and multiple-bounce scattering mechanisms are active in lake ice during the entire freezing period while multiple-bounce scattering is active in sea ice only during the initial freezing. Backscatter parameters can be used to determine the thickness of lake ice up to any depth, while both backscatter and the tested decomposition parameters are related to the thickness of young sea ice (<30 cm thick). Physical explanations are offered in each case. Spatial maps of ice thickness are produced. Polarimetric decomposition parameters demonstrate erratic behavior throughout the development of lake ice. High entropy (>0.6) is found to be associated with comparable single- and multiple-bounce scattering mechanisms, hence can be used to identify new ice. Orthogonal backscatter coefficients and polarimetric decomposition parameters provide different information, yet their combination offers clues to better identify ice conditions and investigate questions about scattering mechanisms.', '[Shokr, Mohammed] Govt Canada, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.

This study aims to present a Statistical, inherent Optical property (IOP)-based, and muLti-conditional Inversion proceDure (SOLID) for enhanced retrievals of satellite-derived TSS under a wide range of in-water bio-optical conditions in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters. In this study, using a large in situ database (N > 3500), the SOLID model is devised using a three-step procedure: (a) water-type classification of the input remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), (b) retrieval of particulate backscattering (b(bp)) in the red or near-infrared (NIR) regions using semi-analytical, machine-learning, and empirical models, and (c) estimation of TSS from b(bp) via water-type-specific empirical models. Using an independent subset of our in situ data (N = 2729) with TSS ranging from 0.1 to 2626.8 [g/m(3)], the SOLID model is thoroughly examined and compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms (Miller and McKee, 2004; Nechad et al., 2010; Novoa et al., 2017; Ondrusek et al., 2012; Petus et al., 2010). We show that SOLID outperforms all the other models to varying degrees, i.e.,from 10 to> 100%, depending on the statistical attributes (e.g., global versus water-type-specific metrics). For demonstration purposes, the model is implemented for images acquired by the MultiSpectral Imager aboard Sentinel-2A/B over the Chesapeake Bay, San-Francisco-Bay-Delta Estuary, Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Taihu. To enable generating consistent, multimission TSS products, its performance is further extended to, and evaluated for, other missions, such as the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Sensitivity analyses on uncertainties induced by the atmospheric correction indicate that 10% uncertainty in R-rs leads to< 20% uncertainty in TSS retrievals from SOLID. While this study suggests that SOLID has a potential for producing TSS products in global coastal and inland waters, our statistical analysis certainly verifies that there is still a need for improving retrievals across a wide spectrum of particle loads.', '[Balasubramanian, Sundarabalan, V; Pahlevan, Nima; Smith, Brandon] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.

Research was broadly categorized into four major themes of (1) time series, including NDVI trends and shrub expansion; (2) disturbance and recovery, including tundra fires, winter warming, herbivory, permafrost disturbance, and anthropogenic change; (3) vegetation properties, including biomass, primary productivity, seasonality, phenology, and pigments; and (4) classification and mapping. Remaining challenges associated with remote sensing of Arctic vegetation were divided into three categories and discussed. The first are issues related to environmental controls including disturbance, hydrology, plant functional types, phenology and the tundra-taiga ecotone, and understanding their influence on interpretation and validation of derived remote sensing trends. The second are issues of upscaling and extrapolation related to sensor physics and the comparability of data from multiple spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. The final category identifies more philosophical challenges surrounding the future of data accessibility, big data analysis, sharing and funding policies among major data providers such as national space agencies and private companies, as well as user groups in the public and private sectors. The review concludes that the best practices for the advancement of optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation include (1) a continued effort to share and improve in situ-validated datasets using camera networks and small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (2) data fusion with non-optical data, (3) sensor continuity, consistency, and comparability, and (4) free availability and increased sharing of data. These efforts are necessary to generate high quality, temporally dense datasets for identifying trends in Arctic tundra vegetation.', '[Beamish, Alison; Fuchs, Matthias; Chabrillat, Sabine] Helmholtz Zentrum Potsdam, German Ctr Geosci GFZ, Telegrafenberg A17, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.

LST is often retrieved from thermal infrared remote sensing data, which have a tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions and are spatially incomplete due to cloud contamination. Land surface model (LSM) output can reflect LST under all-weather conditions, but the spatial resolution is relatively coarse. In this study, a two-step LST data fusion framework was proposed for generating MODIS-like LST (at the satellite overpass time for each day) at a 1 km spatial resolution under all-weather conditions. First, MODIS LST on clear days (i.e., all MODIS LST pixels are cloud-free) for a given study region (e.g., 80 km x 80 km) and China Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) LST at a spatial resolution of similar to 7 km x 7 km were fused using the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM). Second, systematic biases of the fused LST estimates were corrected by MODIS LST for clear pixels on cloudy days. Results indicate that the fused LST after bias correction (fused LSTcorr) under all-weather conditions is highly consistent with in situ LST measurements made at three sites with different land cover types in the north of China, in terms of mean absolute errors of 2.20-3.08 K, root mean square errors of 2.77-3.96 K, and coefficients of determination of 0.93-0.95. The accuracy of these results is comparable to that of the MODIS LST retrievals at all testing sites. In addition, the fused LSTcorr can well reflect spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in LST under all-weather conditions, and there is no significant difference in the accuracy of the fused LSTcorr between the clear and cloudy pixels on cloudy days. The developed approach maximizes the potential of quality MODIS LST retrievals and LSM LST output, and generates LST under all-weather conditions without using ancillary remote sensing and in situ data.

However, the detection of this emission is severely affected by distortions, due to processes of light re-absorption both in the leaf and in the canopy. Even though some advances have been made to correct the signal in the far-red, the whole spectral range needs to be addressed, in order to accurately assess plant physiological state. In 2018, we introduced a model to obtain fluorescence spectra at leaf level, from what was observed at canopy level. In this present work, we publish a revision of that physical model, with a more rigorous and exact mathematical treatment. In addition, multiple scattering between the soil and the canopy, and the fraction of land covered by vegetation have also been taken into consideration. We validate this model upon experimental measures, in three types of crops of agronomic interest (Pea, Rye grass and Maize) with different architecture. Our model accurately predicts both the shape of fluorescence spectra at leaf level from that measured at canopy level and the fluorescence ratio. Furthermore, not only do we eliminate artifacts affecting the spectral shape, but we are also able to calculate the quantum yield of fluorescence corrected for re-absorption, from the experimental quantum yield at canopy level. This represents an advance in the study of these systems because it offers the opportunity to make corrections for both the fluorescence ratio and the intensity of the observed fluorescence.', '[Romero, Juan M.; Gabriela Lagorio, M.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Quim Inorgan Analit & Quim Fis, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.

Understanding glacier velocity also assists in the analysis of ice thickness, ice flux and mass balance. Furthermore, basin/sub-basin wise studies are helpful to understand the climate change over that region instead of monitoring individual glaciers. In the current study, the spatial distribution of glacier velocity is generated for the entire Chandra and Bhaga sub-basins, in the Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh, India, using Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2) differential interferometry pair images with a 14-days temporal gap. The glaciers in Chandra sub-basin are found to have a high flow rate as compared to the glaciers in Bhaga sub-basin. Local slope and ice thickness, which decrease towards the terminus in general, control the movement of valley glaciers, and lower movement rate is observed for most of glaciers towards the terminus/frontal area. However, a few glaciers of Bhaga sub-basin demonstrate an accelerated movement in their frontal areas. This irregular behaviour is also studied in this work and it is discovered that terrain slope and influx of melting water from adjacent glaciers are the major causes for such behaviour of these glaciers. They are, therefore, prone to accelerated mass loss compared to other glaciers in the sub-basin. Another key finding of the anomalous glacier dynamics study is the disintegrating behaviour of glaciers, which is also identified by interpreting the responses of physical scattering mechanisms retrieved from glaciers using fully polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2. Warming temperatures are expected to cause glacier retreat and separation of tributary glaciers from the main glacier body. Melt water from tributary glaciers can further accelerate glacier flow and ice melt in lower part of glacier trunk. This can lead to formation of dead ice zones and disintegration of Himalayan glaciers, which are supported by numerous tributary glaciers. Therefore, we expect that the loss in glacier area due to warming will be larger than the present prediction, where mass loss is considered from conventional way.', '[Singh, Gulab; Nela, Bala Raju; Bandyopadhyay, Debmita; Mohanty, Shradha] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

In southcentral Alaska, willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.) shrubs grow taller than many tree species and account for a substantial proportion of aboveground biomass, yet they are not individually measured as part of the operational Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. The goal of this research was to test methods for landscape-scale mapping of tall shrub biomass in upper montane and subalpine environments using FIA-type plot measurements (n = 51) and predictor variables from imagery-based structure-from-motion (SfM) and airborne lidar. Specifically, we compared biomass models constructed from imagery acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV; similar to 1.7 cm pixels), imagery from the NASA Goddard\'s Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal Airborne Imager (G-LiHT; similar to 3.1 cm pixels), and concomitant G-LiHT small-footprint lidar. Tall shrub biomass was most accurately predicted at 5 m resolution (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 1.09 kg m(-2)) using G-LiHT SfM color and structure variables. Lidar-only models had lower precision (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 1.26 kg m(-2)), possibly due to reduced model information content from variable multicollinearity or lower data density. Separate models for upper montane zones with trees and shrubs and subalpine zones with only shrubs were always chosen over single models based on minimization of Akaike\'s Information Criterion, indicating the need for variable sets robust to overhanging tree canopy. Decreasing point density from UAV (5000-8000 pts. m(-2)) to the G-LiHT SfM point cloud (500-2000 pts. m(-2)) had little impact on model fit, suggesting that high-resolution airborne imagery can extend SfM approaches well beyond line-of-sight restrictions for UAV platforms. Overall, our results confirmed that SfM from high-resolution imagery is a viable approach to estimate shrub biomass in the boreal region, especially when an existing lidar terrain model and local field calibration data are available to quantify uncertainty in the SfM point cloud and landscape-scale estimates of shrub biomass.', '[Alonzo, Michael] Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.

This is done via a novel observation-based approach which employs the concurrent measurement of water levels (WLs) over river and floodplain, analyzing seasonal changes in water surface height differences between the two water bodies. Hydrological connectivity thresholds at different stages during the rising phase were identified, and then validated using field data and remote sensing-driven surface suspended sediment maps. Successful decoupling of the two indiscrete flooding processes during the rising phase: channelized and overbank dispersion processes, is one of the major outcomes of this study. Different roles of the connectivity processes on floodplain hydro-geomorphology are highlighted - that channelized flows determine inundation frequency, residence time and development of positive topographic features in the floodplain, while overbank flows contribute a good part of the seasonal water storage and sediment budget in the floodplain, and tends to smooth positive topography built by channelized flows. The zones of overbank flooding, however, are rather localized due to the well-developed natural levee complex and stable channel-dominated floodplain along the river bank. Lastly, the presented approach is straightforward and solely based on publicly available operational data, making it easily adaptable by non-remote sensing experts. Thus, along with the emergence of new radar altimetry platforms, such as ICESat-2 or Jason-3 that could measure WL of smaller lakes, the proposed approach offers the potential to contribute to research on channel-floodplain systems in other rivers at a global scale.', '[Park, Edward] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore.

However, relatively little work has been done to objectively evaluate soil moisture mean seasonal cycle (SMC) information acquired from different sources. This study evaluates surface (0-10 cm) SMCs obtained from four land surface models (LSMs), two C/X-band and two L-band remote-sensing (RS) products using 5 dense networks and 75 sparse in-situ soil moisture measurement sites located within the contiguous United States. Results show that relative to older C/X-band products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), newer L-band products derived from the Soil Moisture Ocean and Salinity (SMOS) mission provide more accurate SMC estimates (with an average of 35% root-mean-square-error reduction). In fact, the latest SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) product provides SMC intra-seasonal variability and dynamic range information that is 3-34% and 2-37% more accurate, respectively, than all four LSM-based SMCs examined here. Hence, SMC validation against SMOS-IC SMC results may improve LSMs\' ability to accurately capture SMC characteristics, and the common strategy of scaling remote sensing SMC information to match LSM SMC estimates is likely sub-optimal for assimilating L-band soil moisture retrievals. Although the SMOS-IC product has made significant progresses towards retrieving absolute soil moisture values, a temporally constant dry bias is found in SMOS-IC surface SMCs over all land cover types.

Here, we synthesize urban land change algorithms by the types of information they provide to a diverse and growing set of user communities. Two goals of the paper are first to synthesize past and current change detection studies to examine urban land change to help users of remote sensing algorithms understand and navigate the vast variety of available methods, and second to identify gaps in knowledge for the urban remote sensing community. We analyzed 644 peer-reviewed research papers published in English-language journals and conducted a systematic review of urban land change algorithms. All papers included in our study focus on urban land change; studies that concentrate on single-date urban classification or mapping for one point in time without an explicit urban land change component are not included in this analysis. The review showed five key results and knowledge gaps. First, most urban change detection algorithms are being developed and applied for only a few regions, with 75% of studies focused on high or upper-middle-income countries and the majority of these on China or the United States. This suggests a major gap in geographic coverage as well as the need for more studies on cities in low and lower-middle-income countries. Second, the results show that 41% of the algorithms have been developed or applied for cities of over 5 million inhabitants. This focus on large cities is problematic given that only 11% of the world\'s urban population lives in cities with populations greater than 5 million and that most future urban growth will occur in small- and medium-sized towns and cities with populations of fewer than 1 million people. Third, our analysis shows that 62% of the studies use three or fewer time points to measure urban land change with an average study length of 17 years. Since rapidly growing urban areas are highly dynamic, this suggests that existing algorithms using only a few time points are likely missing urban transitions that can only be captured with high temporal frequency analysis. Fourth, we find that urban expansion is the most commonly monitored type of urban land change. Comparatively fewer studies characterized intra-urban change or three-dimensional structural change. Fifth and finally, the results show that an overwhelming majority-87%-of all studies identify only one urban class, highlighting a need for more studies that distinguish intra-urban variation and differentiate multiple urban classes. Our analysis shows that it is very difficult-nearly impossible-to compare across algorithms. Thus, for users of urban land change information, it is difficult to navigate the literature and know which algorithms are most appropriate for a particular use. Taken together, this points to the need for improved reproducibility, replicability, and comparability of studies in order to help harmonize urban land change information across regions and countries. This is especially important given the growing user communities of urban land change products and analysis, especially from policy and practice.', '[Reba, Meredith; Seto, Karen C.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.', 'Yale UniversityRP Reba, M (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.', 'meredith.reba@yale.edu; karen.seto@yale.eduRI Seto, Karen C./C-2722-2008', 'Seto, Karen C./0000-0002-4928-2446; Reba, Meredith/0000-0003-1645-5117', 'NASA [NNX15AD43G]; NASA [809002, NNX15AD43G] Funding Source: Federal   RePORTER', 'Xinyi Li validated the results.

However, sun-target-sensor geometry and within-canopy absorption of SIF can alter the relationship between measured SIF and GPP, because sensors can only retrieve some unknown fraction of the total emitted SIF. Radiative transfer models that allow for variation in canopy structure and sensor angles are therefore needed to properly interpret SIF measurements. Spectral invariants allow decoupling of the wavelength-independent canopy structure and the wavelength-dependent leaf and soil spectrum in the radiative transfer process. Here we develop a simple analytical Fluorescence Radiative Transfer model based on Escape and Recollision probability (FluorRTER) to investigate the impact of canopy structure and sun-target-sensor geometry on SIF emissions. SIF simulations using the FluorRTER model agreed well the one-dimensional Soil-Canopy Observation of Photochemistry and Energy balance (SCOPE) model and the three-dimensional Fluorescence model with Weighted Photon Spread (FluorWPS) model. The fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and clumping effect have a large influence the SIF emission of 3D discontinuous canopies. For a moderate solar zenith angle (30 degrees) and a clumped canopy (FVC = 0.6), the difference between the directional observed SIF of a 3D discontinuous canopy and a 1D homogeneous canopy was as large as 43.2% and 38.4% for Photosystem I + II fluorescence at 685 nm and at 740 nm, respectively. By bridging the gap between observed SIF and total emitted SIF over 3D heterogeneous vegetation canopies, the FluorRTER model can assist with the angular normalization of SIF measurements and enable the more robust interpretation of how variations in SIF from directional and hemispherical in-situ, airborne and satellite observations relate to leaf and whole-canopy physiological processes.', '[Zeng, Yelu; Badgley, Grayson; Anderegg, Leander D.

The objective of this study is to quantify trends in fire size and frequency using data spanning multiple scales in space and time. We use multi-temporal Landsat image compositing on Google Earth Engine and validate results with reference fire maps from the Canadian Park Service. We also interpret general fire trends through the concept of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). Our study site is Wood Buffalo National Park, which is a fire hot spot in Canada due to frequent lightning ignitions. The relativize differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) was the most accurate Landsat-based burn severity metric we evaluated (52.2% producer\'s accuracy, 87.6% user\'s accuracy). The Landsat-based burn severity maps provided a better fit for a linear relationship on the log-log scale of fire size and frequency than a manually drawn fire map. Landsat-based fire trends since 1990 conformed to a power-law distribution with a slope of 1.9, which is related to fractal dimensions of the satellite-based fire perimeter shapes. The unburned and low-severity patches within the burn severity mosaic influenced the power-law slope and associated fractal dimensionality. This study demonstrates a multi-scale and multi-dataset technique to quantify general fire trends and changing fire cycles in remote locations and establishes a baseline database for assessing future fire activity. Testing criticality by power laws helps to quantify emergent trends of contemporary fire regimes, which could inform the strategic application of prescribed fire and other management activities. Natural resource managers can utilize information from this study to understand local ecosystem adaptability to large fire events and ecosystem stability in the context of recent increasing fire activity.', '[Kato, Akira] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Hort, 648 Matsudo, Matsudo, Chiba 2710092, Japan.

In particular, the use of photogrammetrically derived drone-based image point clouds (DIPC) in individual tree detection has become popular. Use of an area-based approach (ABA) in small areas has also been considered. However, in-situ field measurements of sample plots substantially increase the cost of small area forest inventories. Therefore, we examined whether small-scale forest management inventories could be carried out without local field measurements. We used nationwide and regional ABA models for stem volumes fitted with airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to predict stem volumes using corresponding metrics calculated from DIPC data. The stem volumes were predicted at the cell level (15 x 15 m) and aggregated to test plots (30 x 30 m). Height metrics for the dominant tree layer from the DIPC data showed strong correlations with similar metrics computed from the ALS data. The ALS-based models applied with DIPC metrics performed well, especially if the ABA model was fitted in the same geographical area (regional model) and the inventory units were disaggregated to coniferous and deciduous dominated stands using auxiliary information from Multi-source National Forest Inventory data (root mean square error at 30 x 30 m level was 13.1%). The corresponding root mean square error associated with the nationwide ABA model was 20.0% with an overestimation (mean difference 9.6%).', '[Kotivuori, Eetu; Kukkonen, Mikko; Maltamo, Matti; Korhonen, Lauri; Packalen, Petteri] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland.

Recent and on-going L-Band (approximate to 1.4 GHz) spaceborne missions have the potential to provide enhanced information on FT state over large geographic regions with rapid revisit time. However, the low spatial resolution of these spaceborne observations ( 45 km) makes it difficult to isolate the primary contributions (soil, vegetation, snow) to the FT signal in boreal forest. To better quantify these controls, two L-Band radiometers were deployed (September 2016 to July 2017) at a black spruce (Picea mariana) dominated boreal forest site; one unit above and one unit on the ground surface below the canopy to disentangle the microwave contributions of overstory canopy, and the ground surface on the FT brightness temperature (TB) signal. Bi-weekly multi-angular measurements from both units were combined in order to estimate effective scattering albedo (omega) and the microwave vegetative optical depth (tau), using the tau-omega microwave vegetation radiative transfer model. Soil moisture probes were inserted in the trunk of two black spruce and one larch (Larix laricina) trunks located in the footprint of the above-canopy radiometer to measure tree trunk relative dielectric constant (RDCtree). Results showed a strong relationship between RDCtree and tree skin temperature (Thee) under freezing temperature conditions, which led to a gradual decrease of tau in winter. During the spring thawing period in April and May, tau remained relatively stable. In contrast, it increased substantially in June, most likely in relation to the growing season onset. Overall, tau was related to the seasonal RDCtree cycle (r = 0.76). Regarding omega, a value of 0.086 (+/- 0.029) was obtained, but no dependency on T-tree or RDCtree was observed. Despite the observed impact of FT on vegetation L-Band signals, results from continuous TB observations spanning from 14 September 2016 to 25 May 2017, indicated that the main contribution to the observed L-Band TB freeze-up signal in the fall originated from the ground surface. The above-canopy unit showed some sensitivity to overstory canopy FT, yet the sensitivity was lower compared to the signal induced by the ground FT. In April and May, L-Band radiometer FT retrieval agreed closely to the melt onset detection using ADC, but it was likely related to the coincident presence of liquid water in the snow. Our findings have important applications to L-Band spaceborne FT algorithm development and validation across the boreal forest. More specifically, our findings allow better quantification of the potential effect of frozen ground on various biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes in boreal forests.', '[Roy, Alexandre; Mavrovic, Alex] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Dept Sci Environm, Trois Rivieres, PQ, Canada.

Detecting and monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of the disease symptoms caused by Xf at a large scale is key to curtailing its expansion and mitigating its impacts. Here, we combined 3-D radiative transfer modelling (3D-RTM), which accounts for the seasonal background variations, with passive optical satellite data to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of Xf infections in olive orchards. We developed a 3D-RTM approach to predict Xf infection incidence in olive orchards, integrating airborne hyperspectral imagery and freely available Sentinel-2 satellite data with radiative transfer modelling and field observations. Sentinel-2A time series data collected over a two-year period were used to assess the temporal trends in Xf-infected olive orchards in the Apulia region of southern Italy. Hyperspectral images spanning the same two-year period were used for validation, along with field surveys; their high resolution also enabled the extraction of soil spectrum variations required by the 3D-RTM to account for canopy background effect. Temporal changes were validated with more than 3000 trees from 16 orchards covering a range of disease severity (DS) and disease incidence (DI) levels. Among the wide range of structural and physiological vegetation indices evaluated from Sentinel-2 imagery, the temporal variation of the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) and Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) showed superior performance for DS and DI estimation (r(VALUES)(2) > 0.7, p < 0.001). When seasonal understory changes were accounted for using modelling methods, the error of DI prediction was reduced 3-fold. Thus, we conclude that the retrieval of DI through model inversion and Sentinel-2 imagery can form the basis for operational vegetation damage monitoring worldwide. Our study highlight the value of interpreting temporal variations in model retrievals to detect anomalies in vegetation health.', '[Hornero, A.; Hernandez-Clemente, R.; North, P. R.

However, InSAR observations are often contaminated by tropospheric artefacts due to spatial and temporal variations of atmospheric refractivity. Particularly, the topography-dependent stratified delays may introduce seasonal oscillation biases into InSAR-measured deformation time series under steep terrains, which cannot be removed by conventional spatial and temporal filtering. In this study we proposed two complementary approaches to correct the stratified tropospheric delays for time series InSAR analysis when studying single landslides. One is the Iterative Linear Model (ILM) as an improved version of the traditional Linear Model (LM). The other is to fuse tropospheric delays predicted by several global weather models (FDWM) with different temporal intervals and spatial resolutions. Both methods are integrated into the standard Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) time series analysis procedure. We evaluated the proposed methods in three landslide-prone areas in southwest China using Sentinel-1 datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that the ILM method removed the seasonal stratified delays mixed in deformation time series, unaffected by the deforming points. The FDWM method achieved an optimal combination of tropospheric delay predictions by four weather models, i.e. ERA-Interim, ERAS, HRES ECMWF, and MERRA-2. Validations using in-situ GPS measurements suggested that the original Root Mean Squared (RMS) values of interferometric phases declined by more than 35% after both ILM and FDWM corrections. The ILM had better performances than the FDWM to correct stratified delay for single landslides, whereas the FDWM can be an effective alternative when the ILM is inapplicable in case of limited coherent points.', '[Dong, Jie; Gong, Jianya] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

The resulting ash deposits covered Eyjafjallajokull, Myrdalsjokull and parts of Vatnajokull ice caps. In order to quantify the influence of these deposits on albedo, we analyzed albedo evolution across Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull ice caps over the period 2001-2016 using the MOD10A1 and MCD43A3 data products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. A geostatistical model with a daily temporal resolution was used to delineate areas on the ice caps that show distinct ash cover-related albedo reductions over the post-eruption period. Results suggest that despite an overall decrease of the ash cover-related albedo reductions with time, noticeable albedo reductions persist on both, Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull over the entire post-eruption period. These reductions show means of 0.19 +/- 0.11 and 0.17 +/- 0.10, respectively, and occur most prominently during the summer seasons. Persistent albedo reductions are in agreement with and limited to areas of higher ash deposition during the volcanic eruption such as the southern parts of Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull ice caps. In addition, redistribution of Eyjafjallajokull ash deposited on the lowlands in southern Iceland contributed to dust storm events in the years after the eruption and caused additional albedo reductions.', '[Moeller, Rebecca] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Geog, Wullnerstr 5b, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.

Field data collection based on points does not produce spatially continuous information about surface indicators and cannot cover vast geographic areas. Remote sensing is possibly a labor- and time-saving method to estimate important biophysical indicators of vegetation and surface condition at both temporal and spatial scales impossible with field methods. Regression models based on machine learning algorithms, such as random forest (RF), can build relationships between field and remotely sensed data, while also providing error estimates. In this study, field data including over 15,000 points from the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) programs on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands throughout the Western U.S., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters, MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance products with ancillary data were used as predictor variables in a k-fold cross-validation approach to RF modeling. RF regression models were built to predict fourteen indicators of vegetation cover and height, as well as bare gap parameters. The RF model estimates exhibited good correlations with independent samples, with a low bias and a low RMSE. External cross-validation showed good agreement with out-of-bag (OOB) errors produced by RF and also allowed mapping prediction uncertainty. Predicted distribution maps of the surface indicators were produced by using these relationships across the arid and semiarid Western U.S. The bias and RMSE distribution maps show that the sample insufficiency and unevenly pattern of sample strongly impact the accuracy of the RF regression and prediction. The results from this study clearly show the utility of RF as a means to estimate multiple dryland surface indicators from remotely sensed data, and the reliability of the OOB errors in assessing the accuracy of the predictions.', '[Zhang, Junzhe; Okin, Gregory S.; Zhou, Bo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 315 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.', 'University of California System; University of California Los AngelesRP Okin, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 315 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.', 'okin@geog.ucla.eduRI Okin, Greg/D-3226-2019; Zhou, Bo/AAE-5154-2021', 'Zhou, Bo/0000-0002-4331-3811', 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, USA) [NNX17AG50G];   National Science Foundation (NSF, USA) [DEB -1235828]', 'This work was funded by the National Aeronautics and Space   Administration (NASA, USA) grant NNX17AG50G and the National Science   Foundation (NSF, USA) -funded Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological   Research Network (LTER) program DEB -1235828.

Long-term Landsat time series allow for analyzing forest canopy dynamics over several decades at a spatial resolution of 30 m. These dynamics have not been related to plant diversity in the herb layer of forests yet. Here, we related canopy layer dynamics of 132 one hectare temperate forest plots derived from Landsat time series (1985-2015) to herb layer plant species diversity observed in 2015. To quantitatively characterize the dynamics in the canopy over this period, we applied Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation representation (SAX) to yearly NDVI time series of the plots and calculated the frequency of the representations of similar time series patterns, hereafter called SAX-metrics. We used the SAX-metrics as predictors to estimate with beta regression models the Simpson\'s diversity index of the herb layer of our forest plots subdivided into six forest types. Models including SAX-metrics, describing abrupt decreases in NDVI, and high, medium, or low NDVI values had pseudo R-2 between 0.13 and 0.63. We conclude that disturbances, canopy closure, as well as stand age, as represented in NDVI time series, influence the diversity in the herb layer in five of the six examined forest types. Our study shows that information on historic canopy dynamics, detected from Landsat time series, can contribute to a better understanding of current herb layer diversity in some forest types.

One utility of the data has been for detailed mapping of agricultural regions and seasonal identification of crops grown within them. However, the ability to do so has only been applied sporadically and eluded widespread adoption due to cost of the imagery, burdensome preprocessing requirements, and computing not being up to the task. These hurdles have become much reduced of recent with the free and open distribution of the Landsat imagery, emphasis on ready-to-use surface reflectance data products, and distributed high performance computing infrastructures available online in \"the cloud.\" As such, this work leverages these aspects and investigates the ability to retrospectively map summer crops over the United States (US) annually from 1984 to 2007. Google\'s Earth Engine Internet-based analytical platform containing the historical Landsat archive in surface reflectance format was used as a foundation for the classification work. Robust 30 m Cropland Data Layer (CDL) information from US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for years 2008 through 2011 were leveraged to train rule-based classifiers which were applied back through time to each year 1984 through 2007. Focus crops were corn, soybeans, and winter wheat - the three largest by area in the US. A large sampling of highly intensive counties throughout the country were prototyped for generation of the 24 years of historical crop cover. For validation, crop area statistics were calculated for each county-year and compared to survey-based information existing from the USDA. Results were muted overall with the average crop area coefficient of determination (R-2) correlations for the years 1984-2007 found to be 0.192, 0.159, and 0.142 for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat, respectively. Furthermore, the standard deviations were variable at 0.132, 0.177, and 0.133, also respectively. While unimpressive, it was found as a benchmark that the R2 between the 2008 through 2017 CDL classifications were only 0.478, 0.686, and 0.726 and thus a suggestion that the USDA area statistics are an imperfect measure of map accuracy. Deletion of approximately one third to one half of the grossest 1984-2007 outlier years from the historical outputs pulled the correlations to the benchmark standard. Qualitatively, most of the remaining years classified looked of high quality and were believed useful as field-level thematic crop area maps.

Microtopographic variation is a common and functionally important feature of wetlands but is challenging to quantify, constraining estimates of the processes and functions (e.g., habitat diversity, carbon storage) that it regulates. We introduce a novel method of quantifying fine-scale microtopographic structure with Terrestrial Laser Scanning using 10 black ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetlands in northern Minnesota, USA as test cases. Our method reconstructs surface models with fine detail on the order of 1 cm. Our independent validation verifies the surface models capture hummock (local high points) and hollow (local low points) features with high precision (RMSE = 3.67 cm) and low bias (1.26 cm). A sensitivity analysis of surface model resolution showed a doubling of model error between 1 cm and 50 cm resolutions, suggesting high-resolution reconstructions most precisely capture surface variation. We also compared five classification methods at resolutions ranging from 1 cm to 1 m and determined that maximum likelihood classification at 25 cm resolution most accurately (78.7%) identifies hummock and hollow features, but a simple thresholding of surface model elevation and slope was ideal for hummock feature delineation, retaining over 91% of hummock areas. Finally, we test and validate a novel microtopographic delineation method (TopoSeg) that accurately (Bias = 0.2-11.9%, RMSE = 19.6-24.1%) estimates the height, area, volume, and perimeter of individual hummock features. For the first time, we introduce an accurate and automated approach for quantifying fine-scale microtopography through high resolution surface models, feature classification, and feature delineation, enabling geospatial statistics that can explain spatial heterogeneity of habitat structure, soil processes, and carbon storage in wetland systems.', '[Stovall, Atticus E.

Different algorithms often give inconsistent or sometimes conflicting interpretations of the same data. This lack of consensus has adverse implications and can be mitigated via ensemble modeling, an algorithmic paradigm that combines many competing models rather than choosing only a single \"best\" model. Here we report one such time-series decomposition algorithm for deriving nonlinear ecosystem dynamics across multiple timescales-A Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST). As an ensemble algorithm, BEAST quantifies the relative usefulness of individual decomposition models, leveraging all the models via Bayesian model averaging. We tested it upon simulated, Landsat, and MODIS data. BEAST detected changepoints, seasonality, and trends in the data reliably; it derived realistic nonlinear trends and credible uncertainty measures (e.g., occurrence probability of changepoints over time) some information difficult to derive by conventional single-best-model algorithms but critical for interpretation of ecosystem dynamics and detection of low-magnitude disturbances. The combination of many models enabled BEAST to alleviate model misspecification, address algorithmic uncertainty, and reduce over fitting. BEAST is generically applicable to time-series data of all kinds. It offers a new analytical option for robust changepoint detection and nonlinear trend analysis and will help exploit environmental time-series data for probing patterns and drivers of ecosystem dynamics.', '[Zhaoa, Kaiguang] Ohio State Univ, Ohio Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Wooster, OH 44691 USA.

Our objective was to develop a repeatable method to map urban tree canopy cover for the state of Wisconsin. We compared two types of imagery (pan-sharpened 1.5 m SPOT-6 and 1 m NAIP aerial photography), three classification algorithms, seven segment sizes ranging from single pixels to 105 m(2), three levels of compactness for each segment size, and sixteen subsets of features. NAIP outperformed SPOT. On average across classification algorithms there were no significant differences in map agreement. Pixel-based maps with convolution features performed as well as the best segment-based maps. The best segment size tested was 60 m(2) on average, but there was also a local maximum around 15 m(2), which suggests a large range of possible segment sizes must be tested to find the best. The model chosen for application to the whole state was a pixel-level Random Forest classifier with 160 features, and the final state-wide map has five classes: tree/woody vegetation, grass/herbaceous vegetation, impervious surfaces/bare soil, water, and non-forested wetland. Overall accuracy for our state-wide map at the pixel-scale was 79.3% (95% CI: 77.5-81%). Errors occurred due to meter-scale heterogeneity in the urban environment which increases the errors due to spatial misregistration and the number of difficult-to-classify mixed and edge pixels. At larger management level scales, mean absolute error (MAE) decreases to about 10% at the Landsat pixel scale and about 6% at the scale of a city block.

Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) takes advantage of multiple SAR acquisitions to provide 3-D vertical structure of the imaged target. Over forests, parameters such as canopy structure, canopy density, leaf area and phenology contribute to different SAR scattering mechanisms along the vertical dimension of the trees. Tomography has been demonstrated in various earlier works for forest bio-physical parameter estimation using airborne data. In this research work, multi-polarimetric space-borne TanDEM-X tomograms are examined for the first time over a multi-species Indian tropical forest. Multiple TanDEM-X acquisitions are focused using Capon beamforming at five polarimetric channels - HH, HV, VV, HH - VV and HH + VV. Four distinct forest species compartments are selected representing different canopy structure and density. The tomograms obtained in different polarizations for these species are analyzed in detail to understand the scattering patterns across different forest species. Field surveys carried out in several forest locations provide in situ observations of forest height and vertical structure. It was observed that canopy gaps and leaf density play a crucial role for X-band SAR signal penetration through ground. For dense canopy species the backscatter contributions are spread through the canopy, while in case of sparse canopy species, the ground scattering is dominant. Vertical profiles obtained at surveyed plot locations are plotted in all polarizations, and provide a good agreement with field observations. Further, the obtained TomoSAR backscatter layers have a good correlation with field measured above-ground biomass (AGB). The AGB is modeled from TomoSAR with the HH-pol TomoSAR backscatter layer at 27 m canopy height leading to an AGB estimation with correlation r = 0.76 and RMSE of 50.4 t/ha.', '[Khati, Unmesh; Singh, Gulab] Indian Inst Technol, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

Yet, the remote estimation of pCO(2) in coastal waters (under influences of multiple processes) has been difficult due to complex relationships between environmental variables and surface pCO(2). To date there is no unified model to remotely estimate surface pCO(2) in oceanic regions that are dominated by different oceanic processes. In our study area, the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), this challenge is addressed through the evaluation of different approaches, including multi-linear regression (MLR), multi-nonlinear regression (MNR), principle component regression (PCR), decision tree, supporting vector machines (SVMs), multilayer perceptron neural network (MPNN), and random forest based regression ensemble (RFRE). After modeling, validation, and extensive tests using independent cruise datasets, the RFRE model proved to be the best approach. The RFRE model was trained using data comprised of extensive pCO(2) datasets (collected over 16 years by many groups) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) estimated sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), surface chlorophyll concentration (Chl), and diffuse attenuation of downwelling irradiance (Kd). This RFRE-basedpCO(2) model allows for the estimation of surface pCO(2) from satellites with a spatial resolution of 1 km. It showed an overall performance of a root mean square difference (RMSD) of 9.1 mu atm, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.95, a mean bias (MB) of - 0.03 mu atm, a mean ratio (MR) of 1.00, an unbiased percentage difference (UPD) of 0.07%, and a mean ratio difference (MRD) of 0.12% for pCO(2) ranging between 145 and 550 mu atm. The model, with its original parameterization, has been tested with independent datasets collected over the entire GOM, with satisfactory performance in each case (RMSD of <= similar to 10 mu atm for open GOM waters and RMSD of <= similar to 25 mu atm for coastal and river-dominated waters). The sensitivity of the RFRE-based pCO(2) model to uncertainties of each input environmental variable was also thoroughly examined. The results showed that all induced uncertainties were close to, or within, the uncertainty of the model itself with higher sensitivity to uncertainties in SST and SSS than to uncertainties in Chl and Kd. The extensive validation, evaluation, and sensitivity analysis indicate the robustness of the RFRE model in estimating surface pCO(2) for the range of 145-550 mu atm in most GOM waters. The RFRE model approach was applied to the Gulf of Maine (a contrasting oceanic region to GOM), with local model training. The results showed significant improvement over other models suggesting that the RFRE may serve as a robust approach for other regions once sufficient field measured pCO(2) data are available for model training.', '[Chen, Shuangling; Hu, Chuanmin; Barnes, Brian B.] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 7th Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.

This provides clues to understand the intimate structure and evolution of planetary surfaces over ages. In this article we investigate the capacity of the Hapke photometric model, the most widely used in planetary science, to retrieve surface roughness from multiangular reflectance data. Its performance is still a question at issue and we lack validation experiments comparing model retrievals with ground measurements. To address this issue and to show the potentials and limits of the Hapke model, we compare the mean slope angle determined from very high resolution digital elevation models of volcanic and sedimentary terrains sampled in the Asal-Ghoubbet rift (Republic of Djibouti), to the photometric roughness estimated by model inversion on multiangular reflectance data measured on the ground (Chamelon field goniometer) and from space (Pleiades images).

This study served to develop a methodology for utilizing ICESat-2 data over vegetated areas. The specific objectives were to: (1) derive a simulated ICESat-2 photon-counting lidar (PCL) vegetation product using airborne lidar data, (2) examine the use of simulated PCL metrics for modelling aboveground biomass (AGB) along ICESat-2 profiles using a simulated ICESat-2 PCL vegetation product and reference AGB estimated from airborne lidar data, and (3) estimate forest canopy cover using simulated PCL canopy product data and airborne lidar-derived canopy cover. Using existing airborne lidar data for Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) in Texas and known ICESat-2 track locations, PCL simulations were carried out. Three scenarios were analyzed in this study; 1) simulated data without the addition of noise, 2) processed simulated data for daytime, and 3) nighttime scenarios. Segments measuring 100 m along the proposed ICESat-2 tracks were used to extract simulated PCL metrics from each of the three data scenarios and spatially coincident, reference airborne lidar-estimated AGB and airborne lidar canopy cover estimates. Linear regression models were then developed with a subset of the simulated PCL segments to estimate AGB and canopy cover and their performance assessed using separate testing sets. AGB model testing with the simulated dataset without noise, nighttime and daytime scenarios resulted in R-2 values of 0.79, 0.79 and 0.63 respectively, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 19.16 Mg/ha, 19.23 Mg/ha, and 25.35 Mg/ha. Predictive models for canopy cover (4.6 m) achieved R-2 values of 0.93, 0.75 and 0.63 and RMSE values of 6.36%, 12.33% and 15.01% for the simulated dataset without noise, nighttime and daytime scenarios respectively. Findings from this study suggest the potential of ICESat-2 for estimating AGB, given the photon detection rate and background noise anticipated by ICESat-2 under temperate forest settings, and especially in the data format provided by standard ICESat-2 data vegetation products.', '[Narine, Lana L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 534 John Kimbrough Blvd,WFES Bldg,Room 331, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.

The detection limit helps to know to which extent a method is applicable and valid. The detection of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in bare soils is important, because of its vast distribution and its negative effects on humans and the environment. Hyperspectral remote sensing is an acceptable, cost-effective and spatially comprehensive tool, which has detection possibilities of petroleum hydrocarbon. However, previous studies that engaged with this topic did not directly consider the detection limit of the method and no detection limit has been systematically explored. In this study, an outdoor experiment was executed in which three types of soil were contaminated with 14 levels of pure crude oil and measured in outdoor conditions with a hyperspectral camera (950-2500 nm) at three distances from the camera (4, 8 and 12 m). For each soil type, and for each distance, the detection limit was systematically calculated. The results show that the detection limit is a dynamic range affected by the spatial domain and the soil type. Moreover, a significant (p < 0.001) difference between the average detection limit (1.32, 2.09 and 2.90 wt %) of the three soil types was found, suggesting that the detection limit is not only related to the PHC wt% but also depends on the soil type. The results presented in this study can help to improve our understanding of the limitations of hyperspectral remote sensing in direct detection of petroleum hydrocarbon and can be projected to other hyperspectral domains and soils.', '[Pelta, Ran; Ben-Dor, Eyal] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Exact Sci, Porter Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Remote Sensing Lab, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Tel Aviv UniversityRP Pelta, R (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Exact Sci, Porter Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Remote Sensing Lab, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'ranpelta@gmail.com', 'Pelta, Ran/0000-0002-7841-724X', 'Ministry of Science, Technology and Space, Israel [00040366000, 3-13026]', 'This study was financially supported by the Ministry of Science,   Technology and Space, Israel (fund 00040366000, grant no. 3-13026).', 39, 24, 24, 4, 61, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Many key water supply areas are covered by montane forests, which have substantial effects on the amount and timing of snowmelt. In-situ observations of snow-forest interactions have limited spatial coverage and remote sensing using optical sensors (e.g. MODIS) cannot observe snow cover below the canopy. In this study, we developed and verified a lidar-based method to detect snow cover under canopy, investigated how fractional snow covered area (fSCA) varies with topography in open versus under canopy areas and developed a correction factor that could be used to improve satellite derived fSCA products. We developed our new method using three snow-on lidar overflights and verified it with in-situ distributed temperature sensor (DTS) observations at Sagehen Creek watershed in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. DTS validation of lidar classifications showed excellent agreement at 85-96%, including high agreement and large number of returns in under canopy locations. The lidar-derived fSCA observations generally showed earlier snow disappearance under the canopy than in open positions, which is consistent with relatively warm temperatures and greater longwave radiation. However, in contrast to expectations, areas with high solar exposure (i.e. high southwestness) exhibited higher fSCA under the canopy. Results indicated that the k factor (the ratio of under canopy fSCA to open fSCA) varied systematically with southwestness and elevation. Using this factor to correct the study domain fSCA indicated that the typical assumption that k = 1 could lead to an up to similar to 0.05 bias (in fSCA units) towards overestimation. However, within 10 and 100-m individual pixels the fSCA overprediction bias can be 25-30% for higher fSCA values. Although uncertainty would be reduced using higher snow-on lidar point densities, our method shows promise to improve the typical assumption that snow disappearance is identical in under the canopy and in the open (k = 1). Future applications of our lidar-based method at different sites with varying climate, topography and vegetation structure has the dual potential to expand understanding of snow-forest interactions in complex terrain and improve operational fSCA products.', '[Kostadinov, Tihomir S.] Calif State Univ San Marcos, Dept Liberal Studies, San Marcos, CA 92096 USA.

However, most studies have used a rating curve based on a single hydraulic variable or the Manning equation (multiplicative method). In this study, we developed a mathematically different approach to estimating Q by applying the ensemble learning regression method (here termed ELQ), which is one of the machine learning techniques that linearly combine several functions to reduce errors, over the Congo mainstem as a test-bed. Using the training dataset (November 2002 - November 2006) of water levels (H) derived from different Envisat altimetry observations, the ELQ-estimated Q at the Brazzaville in-situ station showed reduced root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 823 m(3) s(-1) (relative RMSE (RMSE normalized by the average in-situ Q, RRMSE) of 2.08%) compared to the Q obtained using a single rating curve. ELQ also showed improved performance for the validation dataset (December 2006 - September 2010). Based on the error analysis, we found the correlation coefficients between input variables affect the performance of ELQ. Thus, we introduced an index, termed the Degree of compensation (I-DoC), which describes how ELQ performs compared to the classic hydraulic relation (e.g., H-Q rating curve). The performance of ELQ improves when I-DoC increases because the additional information could be added in the ELQ process. Since ELQ can combine several variables obtained over different locations, it would be advantageous, particularly if there exist few virtual stations along a river reach. It is expected that ELQ can be also applied to the products of the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, which will provide direct measurements of surface water slope (5), effective river width (W-e), and H, to be launched in 2021.', '[Kim, Donghwan; Yu, Hanwen; Lee, Hyongki] Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA.

Sentinel-2 and Landsat provide observations of similar nature and offer the opportunity to combine both data sources to increase time-series temporal frequency at high spatial resolution. Multi-sensor image compositing is one way for performing pixel-level data integration and has many advantages for processing frameworks, especially if analyses over larger areas are targeted. Our compositing approach is optimized for narrow temporal-intervals and allows the derivation of time-series of consistent reflectance composites that capture field level phenologies. We processed more than a year\'s worth of imagery acquired by Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. We used all data acquired over Germany and integrated observations into composites for three defined temporal intervals (10-day, monthly and seasonal). Our processing approach includes generation of proxy values for OLI in the MSI red edge bands and temporal gap filling on the 10-day time-series. We then derive a national scale crop type and land cover map and compare our results to spatially explicit agricultural reference data available for three federal states and to the results of a recent agricultural census for the entire country. The resulting map successfully captures the crop type distribution across Germany at 30 m resolution and achieves 81% overall accuracy for 12 classes in three states for which reference data was available. The mapping performance for most classes was highest for the 10-day composites and many classes are discriminated with class specific accuracies > 80%. For several crops, such as cereals, maize and rapeseed our mapped acreages compare very well with the official census data with average differences between mapped and census area of 11%, 2% and 3%, respectively. Other classes (grapevine and forest classes) perform slightly less well, likely, because the available reference data does not fully capture the variability of these classes across Germany. The inclusion of the red edge bands slightly improved overall accuracies in all cases and improved class specific accuracies for most crop classes. Similarly, our gap filling procedure led to improved mapping accuracies when compared to nongap-filled 10-day features. Overall, our results demonstrate the valuable potential of approaches that utilize data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat which allows for detailed assessments of agricultural and other land-uses over large areas.', '[Griffiths, Patrick; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

Unfortunately, residual noise in current NDVI time-series products greatly hinders their further applications. Several noise-reduction methods have been proposed during the past two decades, but two important issues remain to be resolved. First, the methods usually perform poorly for cases of continuous missing data in the NDVI time series. Second, they generally assume negatively biased noise in the NDVI time series and thus erroneously raise some local low NDVI values in certain cases (e.g., the harvest period for multi-season crops).We therefore developed a new noise-reduction algorithm called the Spatial-Temporal Savitzky-Golay (STSG) method. The new method assumes discontinuous clouds in space and employs neighboring pixels to assist in the noise reduction of the target pixel in a particular year. The relationship between the NDVI of neighboring pixels and that of the target pixel was obtained from multi-year NDVI time series thanks to the accumulation of NDVI data over many years, which would have been impossible a decade ago. We tested STSG on 16-day composite MODIS NDVI time-series data from 2001 to 2016 in regions of mainland China and 11 phenology camera sites in North American. The results showed that STSG performed significantly better compared with four previous widely used methods (i.e., the Asymmetric Gaussian, Double Logistic, Fourier-based, and Savitzky-Golay filter methods). One obvious advantage was that STSG was able to address the problem of temporally continuous NDVI gaps. STSG effectively increased local low NDVI values and simultaneously avoided overcorrecting low NDVI values during the crop harvest period. In addition, implementing STSG required only raw MODIS NDVI time-series products without any additional burden of data requirements. All of these advantages make STSG a promising noise-reduction method for generating high quality NDVI time-series data.', '[Cao, Ruyin; Chen, Yang; Zhou, Jin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.

OCO-2 is a NASA mission designed to measure atmospheric CO2 but one of the novel data products is SIF, retrieved using reductions in the optical depth of Fraunhofer lines in OCO-2\'s O-2 Aband, covering 757-775 nm at 0.042 nm spectral resolution. CFIS was specifically designed to retrieve SIF within the wavelength range of OCO-2, but extends further down to 737 nm, nearly maintaining the high spectral resolution of the OCO-2 instrument (0.07 vs. 0.042 nm). Here, we provide an overview of the instrument calibration and performance as well as the retrieval strategy based on non-linear weighted least-squares. To illustrate the retrieval performance using actual flight data, we focus on data acquired over agricultural fields in Mead, Nebraska from an unpressurized Twin Otter (DHC-6) aircraft at a flight altitude of 3000 m above ground level (AGL). Spectral residuals are consistent with expected detector noise, which enables us to compute realistic 1-alpha precision errors of 0.5-0.7 W/m(2)/sr/mu m for typical SIF retrievals, which can be reduced to < 0.2 W/m(2)/sr/mu m when individual data is gridded at 30 m spatial resolution. The 30 m resolution also enabled direct comparison with the Crop Data Layer from the National Agricultural Statistics Service as well as Landsat imagery (NDVI, EVI, T-sk(in)), taken just a day prior to the CFIS overflights. Results show consistently higher vegetation indices and SIF values over soy fields compared to corn, likely due to the respective phenological stage, which might already have affected chlorophyll content and canopy structure (August 15, 2016). While this work is intended to highlight the technical capabilities and performance of CFIS, the comparisons against Landsat and crop types provide insights into how CFIS can be used to study mechanisms related to photosynthesis at fine spatial scales, with the fidelity needed to obtain un-biased SIF retrievals void of atmospheric correction.', '[Frankenberg, Christian; Kohler, Philipp; Magney, Troy S.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.

This study proposes an approach for holistically characterising and analysing forest dynamics across large areas and long-time periods using information derived from Landsat time series. To achieve this, we first developed a two-phase classification process to predictively map (1) disturbance and recovery levels and (2) disturbance causal agents for multiple detected disturbance events. The model explanatory data included a range of trajectory-based metrics derived from Landsat time-series, while model training and validation data were derived from a human-interpreted reference dataset. While previous studies have often described forest dynamics using some specific spectral change metrics, we demonstrated an ensemble approach to map disturbance and recovery trends (by treating them as a single metric) and to characterise not only abruptly occurring change events (e.g., clear-fell logging and wildfire) but also events of low severity (e.g., prescribed burning and selective logging). In addition, we adopted a space-time data cube concept to simultaneously report both newly detected disturbance events (detected disturbances) as well as events that have previously occurred but are ongoing (ongoing disturbances). This ongoing element of forest dynamics is often under-reported. The method was tested over 3.7 million ha of public land sclerophyll forests, where multiple disturbance events have occurred over the last 30 years (1987-2016). Our models of disturbance and recovery levels obtained overall accuracies of 78.6% and 72.3% for primary and secondary disturbance events, respectively. The overall accuracies for the models of disturbance causal agents were 80.7% and 73.0%, respectively. The data cube reported an average annual disturbance rate of 4.2% per year. This was dominated by newly detected disturbance (2.7% per year) as distinct from ongoing disturbance that was, however, considerable (1.5% per year).

The evolution of the iceberg area was determined from ENVISAT ASAR images, and the freeboard change was derived from CryoSat-2 profiles. Two patterns of iceberg area decreases are observed during iceberg drifting. In austral summer (from October to next March), iceberg area shows a gradual decrease and it is interpreted to represent edge wasting, sidewall melting and wave erosion, the gradual decrease of the area of C28A occurred at rates between 8.1 km(2)/month and 16.5 km(2)/month. In austral winter (from April to September), iceberg area has several discrete decreases (sudden drop) while it remained constant for most of the time, and it is interpreted to be large rift calving primarily caused by ocean swell and basal melting.

The freeboard decreased at different rates at different locations on the same iceberg (between -0.02 +/- 0.22 and -0.82 +/- 0.28 m/month for C28A and C28B), suggesting a laterally inhomogeneous melting of icebergs.

Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) has been successfully demonstrated as a means to derive a suite of forest structure attributes at the plot level; however, these acquisitions are often constrained to limited spatial extents and to a given point in time. Sample based approaches for model development can accommodate the spatial limitations of lidar acquisitions when characterizing large areas. The combination of lidar plot data and time-series satellite imagery is well suited to provide spatially extensive, and temporally dense, information on forest structure and related dynamics over very large areas. In this research, we combine lidar plot-derived information with Landsat pixel-based composites to produce annual forest structure estimates from 1984 to 2016 over 650 million ha of Canada\'s forest ecosystems using a nearest neighbor imputation approach with a Random Forests-based distance metric. Imputed variables included lidar metrics of height (e.g., mean height, standard deviation of height) and cover, as well as area-based modelled inventory estimates of Lorey\'s height, basal area, stem volume, and biomass. Models were validated using reserved validation plots, with model R-2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.64 for lidar metrics of height and cover, and R-2 of 0.67, 0.68, 0.71, and 0.70 for Lorey\'s height, basal area, volume and biomass, respectively. Unique to this study was the assessment of model extension through time, with model performance for imputing lidar metrics evaluated at the forest stand-level using independent lidar data representing a latitudinal gradient of forest conditions and that was not used in model development. The period evaluated was 2006-2012, with R-2 values ranging from 0.36 to 0.66 for height metrics, and 0.47-0.77 for cover metrics. Ultimately, we show how deriving forest structural estimates on an annual basis enables the analysis of both the dynamics and regional trends of undisturbed forest, as well as regenerating stands following stand-replacing disturbances (i.e., fire, harvesting).', '[Matasci, Giona; Hermosilla, Txomin; Coops, Nicholas C.; Bolton, Douglas K.; Tompalski, Piotr] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, Integrated Remote Sensing Studio, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

This requires an accurate separation of the surface spectral reflectance below the cloud and that coming from the ice cloud particle. In this paper, a weighting-function based method is described, which retrieves ice cloud optical thickness (COT) and ice cloud crystal effective radius (CER). The retrieval algorithm belongs to the newly developed eXtensible Bremen Aerosol Retrieval (XBAER) algorithm family, and is called XBAER-ice. The XBAER-ice retrieval uses a surface reflectance parameterization minimizing the impact of surface scattering on the retrieval of optically thin ice cloud properties. A fractal model is used to describe the ice cloud optical properties. The comparison of COT and CER between XBAER-ice and latest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products shows good agreement. We note that ice cloud property retrievals are particularly sensitive to assumptions about the ice particle shape. The comparison between satellite derived COTs using both the MODIS C6 product and XBAER-ice algorithm agree well with Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) in-situ measurements (with correlation coefficient above 0.9) whereas CERs show poorer agreement (similar to 0.6). The global spatial distribution patterns and values of COT from ice clouds retrieved by using the MODIS C6 and XBAER-ice algorithms show a high degree of consistency. The XBAER-ice derived ice cloud CER values are systematically smaller than the MODIS C6 product, but both products have similar spatial distribution patterns.

While previous missions have used infrared lasers to make these measurements, NASA\'s upcoming ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite)-2 mission will use a green laser. Because ice absorbs green light very weakly, in the absence of light-absorbing impurities, green photons can scatter off many snow grains before returning to the surface, delaying the return pulse and leading to an apparent downward shift in the snow surface. In this paper, we explore the effects of snow-grain size and impurity content on these measurements, and investigate strategies that might help minimize the biases they introduce. We find that an uninformed choice of measurement parameters (a windowed mean including a large range of photons around the surface) can result in > 0.45 m of apparent surface-height variation between large and small grain sizes. Other choices of measurement parameters, such as a windowed median, can reduce this uncertainty by a factor of two to three.

Compared with the widely used passive retrieval method (e.g., MODIS retrieval), which considers N-d as function of cloud optical depth, geometry thickness and effective radius, retrieval method of the new N-d dataset has a weak dependence upon the cloud adiabatic assumption and eliminates the possible bias caused by multilayer clouds. Statistical results show that the annual cycle and long-term variability of N-d retrieved by CALIPSO agree reasonably well with those obtained from MODIS retrieval method, especially over the stratocumulus regions (correlation coefficient > 0.9). Multiple regression models and contribution calculation verify that the variability of sulfate mass concentration dominates the long-term variation of N-d over most regions, even though the contribution factors and rates vary with different regions, temperatures and methods. In addition, our study also indicates that the impact of BC and OC on N-d should not be ignored, especially for supercooled water clouds over those important biomass burning regions.

Valid measurements are scarce in large areas of the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans, because sea level can only be estimated in the openings in the sea ice (leads and polynyas). Similar signal-related problems affect also measurements in coastal and inland waters.   This study presents a fitting (also called retracking) strategy (ALES +) based on a subwaveform retracker that is able to adapt the fitting of the signal depending on the sea state and on the slope of its trailing edge. The algorithm modifies the existing Adaptive Leading Edge Subwaveform retracker originally designed for coastal waters, and is applied to Envisat and ERS-2 missions.   The validation in a test area of the Arctic Ocean demonstrates that the presented strategy is more precise than the dedicated ocean and sea ice retrackers available in the mission products. It decreases the retracking open ocean noise by over 1 cm with respect to the standard ocean retracker and is more precise by over 1 cm with respect to the standard sea ice retracker used for fitting specular echoes. Compared to an existing open ocean altimetry dataset, the presented strategy increases the number of sea level retrievals in the sea ice-covered area and the correlation with a local tide gauge. Further tests against in-situ data show that also the quality of coastal retrievals increases compared to the standard ocean product in the last 6 km within the coast.   ALES + improves the sea level determination at high latitudes and is adapted to fit reflections from any water surface. If used in the open ocean and in the coastal zone, it improves the current official products based on ocean retrackers. First results in the inland waters show that the correlation between water heights from ALES + and from in-situ measurement is always over 0.95.', '[Passaro, Marcello; Boergens, Eva; Dettmering, Denise] Tech Univ Munich, Deutsch Geodat Forschungsinst, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.

Visual analysis and elevation histograms point to a finer effective spatial (i.e., horizontal) resolution of TanDEM-X compared to SRTM and ASTER GDEM. In areas of open vegetation, TanDEM-X lower elevations indicate a deeper penetration of the radar signal. DEMs of differences (DoDs) allowed the identification of issues inherent to the production methods of the analyzed DEMs, such as mast oscillations in SRTM data and mismatch between adjacent scenes in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30. A systematic difference in elevations between TanDEM-X 12 m, TanDEM-X 30 m, and SRTM was observed in the steep slopes of the coastal ranges, related to the moving-window process used to resample the 12 m data to a 30 m pixel size. It is strongly recommended to produce a DoD with SRTM before using ASTER GDEM or ALOS AW3D30 in any analysis, to evaluate if the area of interest is affected by these problems. The DoDs also highlighted changes in land use in the time span between the acquisition of SRTM (2000) and TanDEM-X (2013) data, whether by natural causes or by human interference in the environment. The results show a high level of detail and consistency for TanDEM-X data, indicate that the effective horizontal resolution of SRTM is coarser than the nominal 30 m, and highlight the errors in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 due to mismatch between adjacent scenes in the photogrammetric process.', '[Grohmann, Carlos H.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Energy & Environm, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Universidade de Sao PauloRP Grohmann, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Energy & Environm, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'guano@usp.brRI Grohmann, Carlos/A-9030-2008; Fapesp, Biota/F-8655-2017', 'Grohmann, Carlos/0000-0001-5073-5572; Fapesp, Biota/0000-0002-9887-8449', 'Brazil\'s National Council of Scientific and Technological Development,   CNPq [307647/2015-3]; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)   [2016/06628-0]; FAPESP (BIOTA) [2012/50260-6, 2013/50297-0]; NSF [DEB   1343578]; NASA; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological   Sciences [1343578] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Fundacao   de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [16/06628-0]   Funding Source: FAPESP', 'This study was supported by Brazil\'s National Council of Scientific and   Technological Development, CNPq grant 307647/2015-3, theSao Paulo   Research Foundation (FAPESP) grant # 2016/06628-0, and is co-funded by   FAPESP (BIOTA # 2012/50260-6, # 2013/50297-0),NSF (DEB 1343578), and   NASA.

We produce fraction images of urban surfaces, soil, permanent vegetation and seasonal vegetation for each time step. Statistical evaluation shows that a temporally generalized, hi-seasonal model over all time steps performs equally or better than yearly or mono-seasonal models and provides reliable cover fractions. Urban fractions can be used to visualize pixel-based spatial-temporal patterns of urban densification and expansion. A simple rule set based on a seasonal vegetation to soil ratio is appropriate to delineate areas of unplanned and planned settlements and, thus, contributes to monitoring urban development on a neighborhood scale.', '[Schug, Franz; Okujeni, Akpona; Hauer, Janine; Hostert, Patrick; Nielsen, Jonas O.; van der Linden, Sebastian] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

The surface manifestations of these internally propagating waves are curvilinear bands demarcating relatively smooth and rough surface waters, providing a means for their detection via observations of sunglint. Typical horizontal scales of NLIWs are such that traditionally only high resolution (< 1 km pixel) sensors aboard polar orbiting satellites could resolve them. The launch on 28 October 2014 of the Japanese Meteorological Agency\'s Himawari-8 geostationary satellite and its Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) opens up possibilities to study the spatio-temporal change of these relatively small scale NLIW features from geostationary orbit. Himawari-8 provides 500-m resolution visible imagery every 10 min over a hemispheric field of regard centered at 140.7 degrees E longitude. These spatial and temporal resolutions allow for not only the identification of NLIWs over the low latitude regions such as the Indonesian Seas, but also the ability to track the evolution of these waves in real time. Here, we present examples of NLIWs as viewed from Himawari-8/AHI and calculate a few basic wave quantities, including wavelength and propagation speed. These quantities were found to be consistent with previous observations and model simulations of NLIWs, but observations from AHI provide the ability to calculate wave propagation speeds in the same locations over multiple times a day for multiple days, which is impossible with polar-orbiting satellite data. Geostationary observations will augment the existing database of observed NLIWs and help to better quantify their spatial and temporal attributes.', '[Lindsey, Daniel T.] NOAA, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Ft Collins, CO USA.

Targeted conservation and restoration efforts, however, have proven successful, particularly in Europe and North America. Such efforts require accurate protocols to identify, assess, and map wetlands repeatedly to enable detection of change. High resolution (i.e. 2-meter pixel) satellite imagery has proven effective to map wetlands at higher accuracies than historical 30-meter or coarser satellite data.

In this paper, we aim to develop a methodology to derive terrain elevation and vegetation canopy height from test-bed sensor data and further pre-validate the capacity of the mission to meet its science objectives for the ecosystem community. We investigated a novel methodological framework with two essential steps for characterizing terrain and canopy height using Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental LiDAR (MABEL) data and simulated ICESat-2 data with various vegetation conditions. Our algorithm first implements a multi-level noise filtering approach to minimize noise photons and subsequently classifies the remaining photons into ground and top of canopy using an overlapping moving window method and cubic spline interpolation. Results of noise filtering show that the design of the multi-level filtering process is effective to identify background noise and preserve signal photons in the raw data. Moreover, calibration results using MABEL and simulated ICESat-2 data share similar trends with the retrieved terrain being more accurate than the retrieved canopy height, and the nighttime results being better than corresponding daytime results. Compared to the results of simulated ICESat-2 data, MABEL data achieve lower accuracy for ground and canopy heights in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), which may partly result from the inconsistency between MABEL and reference data. Specifically, simulated ICESat-2 data using 115 various nighttime and daytime scenarios, yield average RMSE values of 1.83 m and 2.80 m for estimated ground elevation, and 2.70 m and 3.59 m for estimated canopy height. Additionally, the accuracy assessment of percentile heights of simulated ICESat-2 data further substantiates the robustness of the methodology from different perspectives. The methodology developed in this study illustrates plausible ways of processing the data that are structurally similar to expected ICESat-2 data and holds the potential to be a benchmark for further method adjustment once genuine ICESat-2 are available.', '[Popescu, S.

In particular, novel lightweight 2D spectral imagers in combination with UAVs are increasingly being adapted for imaging spectroscopy. In contrast to traditional line scanners, these sensors capture spectral information as a 2D image within every exposure. With computer vision algorithms embedded in consumer grade software packages, these data can be processed to hyperspectral digital surface models that hold spectral and 3D spatial information in very high resolution. To understand the spectral signal, however, one must comprehend the complexity of the capturing and data processing process in imaging spectroscopy with 2D imagers.   This study establishes the theoretical background to comprehend the properties of spectral data acquired with 2D imagers and investigates how different data processing schemes influence the data. To improve the interpretability of a spectral signal derived for an area of interest (AOI, the specific field of view is introduced as a concept to understand the composition of pixels and their angular properties used to characterize a specific AOI within a remote sensing scene.   These considerations are applied to a multi-temporal field study carried out under different illumination conditions in a barley field phenotyping experiment. It is shown that data processing significantly affects the angular properties of the spectral data and influences the apparent spectral signature. The largest differences are found in the red domain, where the signal differs by approximately 10% relative to a single nadir image. Even larger differences of approximately 14% are found in comparison with ground-based non-imaging field spectrometer measurements. The differences are explained by investigating the interaction between the angular properties of the data and canopy anisotropy, which are wavelength and growth stage dependent. Additionally, it is shown that common vegetation indices cannot normalize the differences and that the retrieval of chlorophyll is affected. In conclusion, this study helps to understand the process of imaging spectroscopy with 2D imagers and provides recommendations for future missions.', '[Aasen, Helge] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Crop Sci Grp, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.

Because the conditions of clouds and Earth\'s surfaces vary widely, incorrect results in actual cloud detection operations are unavoidable. Cloud detection methods therefore should be adjustable to easily reduce the frequency of incorrect results under certain conditions, without causing new incorrect results under other conditions. Cloud detection methods are also required to resolve a characteristic issue: the boundary between clear-sky and cloudy-sky areas in nature is vague, because the density of the cloud particles continuously varies. This vagueness makes the cloud definition subjective. Furthermore, the training dataset preparation for machine learning should avoid circular arguments. The SVM learning is generally less likely to result in overfitting: this study suggests that only typical data are sufficient for the SVM training dataset. By incorporating the discriminant analysis (DA), it is possible to subjectively determine the definition of typical cloudy and clear sky and to obtain typical cloud data without direct cloud detection. In an approach to adjust the classifier, data typical of certain conditions that lead to incorrect results are added to the training dataset. In this study, an adjustment procedure is proposed, which quantitatively judges, whether an addition is actually effective for reduction of the frequency of incorrect results. Another approach for the adjustment is improving feature space used for cloud detection. Indices as quantitative guidance to estimate whether an addition or elimination of a feature actually reduces the frequency of incorrect results can be obtained from the analysis of the support vectors. The cloud detection method incorporating the SVM is therefore able to integrate practical adjustment procedures. Applications of this method to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data demonstrate that the concept of the method satisfies the requirements and the adjustability to various conditions can be realized.', '[Ishida, Haruma] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.

These processes can e.g. cause damage to buildings and infrastructure, affect ecosystems and agriculture or affect the economic use of the geological underground by influencing the hydrogeological setting. Despite the maturity and operational readiness of the PSI technology it is rarely used in operational workflows of the German user community (e.g. from responsible authorities).   In order to support the operational use of this technique a \"Ground Motion Service Germany\" has been designed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) in collaboration with the user community, land surveying agencies, SME and research institutions. A major outcome of this collaboration is the user request regarding a PSI-WAP (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Wide-Area-Product) dataset of the entire nation (approx. 360,000 km(2)) based on Sentinel-1 data. For this reason the PSI mapping coverage is increased by mosaicking PSI data products from adjacent SAR data stacks. Several case studies has been performed to demonstrate the design of the service. Within this paper one case study regarding the PSI-WAP technique and the calibration/validation scheme is presented.   The pilot study is focusing on the built up of an officially approved PSI-WAP dataset. The study area covers an area of >30,000 km(2) and is located in the Northwest German Basin. This is the first time a PSI-WAP analysis is performed in this area. Several natural processes (e.g. compaction of marine sediments, peat growth/shrinkage) and anthropogenic activities (e.g. natural gas extraction, rock salt mining) are causing surface displacements in the study area. The PSI-WAP analysis is based on six adjacent ERS-1/-2 data stacks covering the timespan from 1992 until 2001. Each data stack consists of 49 to 73 acquisitions. A comparison of the PSI results with thematic data (e.g. cumulated volume of extracted natural gas and location of natural gas fields) indicates that a part of the detected land subsidence is caused by natural gas extraction.   To summarize, this paper shows i) the design of the \"Ground Motion Service Germany\" and ii) a pilot study to exemplarily demonstrate a PSI-WAP, the calibration/validation scheme and value-added-products.

Nonetheless, global information about the space-time variations of the area of freshwater bodies, and the water stored in them, is surprisingly limited. We introduce a new approach that uses MODIS multispectral data to map the global areal extent and temporal variations of known reservoirs at 500 m spatial resolution at nominal eight-day intervals from 2000 to 2015. We evaluate the performance of the approach on 94 reservoirs by comparing the variations in surface area extents with satellite radar altimetry measurements. Furthermore, we present detailed case studies for five reservoirs on four continents to demonstrate the impact of different challenges on the performance of the approach. For three of these case studies, we also evaluate surface area estimates using Landsat-based surface extent reference maps. Altimetry based height measurements for the 94 reservoirs show higher correlation with surface area computed using our approach, compared to surface area computed using previous approaches. One of the main reasons for these improvements is a novel post-processing technique that makes use of imperfect labels produced by supervised classification approaches on multiple dates to estimate the elevation structure of locations and uses it to enhance the quality and completeness of imperfect labels. However, effective estimation of this elevation structure requires that the water body shows sufficient area variations. Hence, the post-processing approach will not be effective for water bodies that are mostly unchanged or are too small to have sufficient variation. The approach is still challenged in regions with frequent cloud cover, snow and ice coverage, or complicated geometries that will require remote sensing data at finer spatial resolution. The surface area estimates we describe here are publically available.

Urban trees contribute significantly in mitigating the urban heat island effect and supporting biodiversity. However, accurate and up-to-date mapping of urban tree species is difficult because of the time-consuming nature of field sampling, fine-scale spatial variation, and potentially high species diversity. Advanced remote sensing data such as airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with high pulse density (25 point/m(2)) and hyperspectral imagery offer two different yet complementary approaches to estimating crown structure and canopy physiological information at the individual crown scale, which can be useful for mapping tree species. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of these technologies to map 15 common urban tree species using a Random Forest (RF) classifier in the City of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada.

Results indicate an overall accuracy of 51.1%, 61.0%, and 70.0% using hyperspectral, LiDAR and the combined data respectively.

Acquiring accurate information on precipitation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which has a limited rain gauge network, has been a great challenge. Downscaling the TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B43 Version 7 dataset (0.25 resolution) provided an optimal approach to estimating precipitation at 1 km resolution over this highland plateau. Our downscaling assumptions were that non-stationary relationships between precipitation and land surface characteristics occur and have varying two-dimensional scale effects, and that the relationships vary in different sub-regions having differing combinations of land surface characteristics, including vegetation index, topographical factors, and land surface temperatures. We used Cubist (a spatial data mining algorithm) to implement our assumption. Cubist separated the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into sub-regions according to geographical similarities, and selected the most effective variables over each sub-region to build models. We found that: (1) the downscaled results using this algorithm were more accurate and precise than other commonly used algorithms (e.g., geographically weighted regression) and the original TMPA data at 0.25 resolution; (2) DEM showed limited correlation with precipitation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; and (3) the effects of systematic anomalies in the original TMPA data were removed in the downscaled results based on Cubist. We conclude that Cubist is a promising algorithm able to take hundreds of variables into consideration, and in this study was used to retrieve precipitation estimates at approximately 1 km resolution.', '[Ma, Ziqiang; Shi, Zhou; Zhou, Yin; Yang, Yuanyuan] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Inst Agr Remote Sensing & Informat Technol Applic, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

During the 2014-2015 austral summer, an exceptional situation was recorded by both the DOMEX ground radiometer and the European Space Agency (ESA)\'s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. From November 2014 to March 2015, T-B H showed a progressive and significant increase until 20 March 2015 when it sharply decreased by about 5 K (at 52.5 incidence angle) within a few days. In parallel to the increase in T-B H, glaciological and meteorological in situ measurements showed a wind speed that was lower than usual and a low-density snow layer being progressively set up on the surface. This was consistent with the exceptional hoar event observed, as well as with snow accumulation on the surface. On the other hand, the decrease in T-B H was related to the passing over Dome C of a storm that removed or compacted the layer of light snow on the surface. The WALOMIS (Wave Approach for LOw-frequency Microwave emission in Snow) snow-emission model was used with in situ measurements of the snowpack as inputs for evaluating the effect of changes observed on the snow surface in T-B H. The simulations indicated that the surface snow density variations were sufficient for predicting the increasing and decreasing trends of the T-B H. However, the thickness variations of the superficial layer were essential so as to obtain a better agreement with the SMOS observations. This result confirmed that the L-band T-B H was affected by the snow properties of the top centimeters of the snowpack, in spite of the large penetration depth (hundreds of meters). Both the surface snow density and the thickness of the superficial layer were relevant, due to coherent interference effects.', '[Leduc-Leballeur, M.; Macelloni, G.; Brogioni, M.] CNR, IFAC, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.

Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10 days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunflower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel -2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key findings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described. This study points out the interest of SAR data and particularly the VH/VV ratio, which is poorly documented in previous studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Connectivity processes are related to 12 geomorphic sub-units of the floodplain that are interconnected at different stage thresholds through channelized and overbank flow paths, while lakes act as reservoirs for flood waters, local rainfall, and water table saturation-seepage. Hydrological connectivity processes along the floodplain happen through complex internal routings of water flows over space and time, mainly along floodplain channels and breached levees. The contribution of local recharge (mainly rainfall) was decoupled from river recharge (river hydrological connection to floodplain) because precipitations and local runoff also recharge the floodplain. The hydrological connectivity of the 12 geomorphic units varied significantly from each other, because the inundation and the floodplain connections with the river were initiated at specific river stage thresholds for each sub-unit.   An interesting finding is that connections with the river for all units were initiated through channelized flows below the bankfull stage of the Amazon River. The connectivity processes over different geomorphic units are also not correlated with their minimum distance (shortest lines) from the river. This implies that a \"flood pulse\" model largely concerned with lateral connectivity (mostly through overbank diffusion) only partially explains the complex hydrological connectivity processes at a regional scale along the complex lower Amazon River floodplain. Thus, for hydrological connectivity assessments in the Amazon River floodplain, reach-by-reach scale studies have to be carried out, relating the hydro-geomorphologic processes (channelized flow routing paths, overbank diffusion, and local recharge) to the internal geomorphic variability and complexity of the floodplain.

However, a combination of these three variables has not been used to estimate the dryness. In this study, a 3 Dimensional (3D) space of the LST, Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI), and SM was developed to define a new dryness index named the Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture Dryness Index (TVMDI). The TVMDI was evaluated against in situ SM and soil temperature data, as well as the NDVI. The results demonstrated that the TVMDI values were highly correlated with the field soil temperature data and the NDVI (R = 0.78 and R = -0.87, respectively). However, even though the dryness values estimated from the TVMDI were not highly correlated with the in situ SM data, the correlation was still acceptable (R = -0.65). Furthermore, a comparison between the proposed index and several satellite-based dryness indices, including the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), Second Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI1), and Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), concluded that the TVMDI was the most accurate index. Moreover, using the TVMDI and multi-temporal Landsat 8 images two dryness maps were produced for the Yanco area to show the effectiveness of the proposed index in depicting the temporal and spatial variation of dryness values for medium spatial resolution images. To show the effectiveness of the TVMDI in large scale applications, two dryness maps from the all of Australia and Iran were also produced using the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. Overall, it was concluded that the TVMDI had a high potential to map dryness over different regions, and is a promising index for early awareness of drought risk management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Through the integration of remotely sensed data and FVC estimation models, FVC can be routinely and periodically monitored using remote sensing images over large areas. However, due to frequent cloud contamination and trade-offs in satellite sensor design, the FVC estimates from remote sensing data are not continuous, either spatially or temporally, and cannot simultaneously depict details in spatio-temporal variation. Taking the seasonally inundated Zoige alpine wetland in China as a case area, the objective of this paper is to develop a practical and effective approach to quantifying the explicit vegetation FVC details with both high spatial and temporal resolution. In this approach, 30-m multi-spectral images from the Chinese HJ-1A/B (HuanJing (HJ), which means environment in Chinese) satellite constellation with a 2-day revisit time were first composited at 16-day intervals to improve spatio-temporal continuity. Then, a new adaptive endmember selection linear spectral mixture model (ASLSMM) was proposed to improve the accuracy of FVC estimation by considering the endmember dynamics for each pixel. FVC time series were finally estimated by applying the ASLSMM to the cloudless HJ composites. The performance of the model and the spatio-temporal representational capability of the FVC estimation results were comprehensively evaluated using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) reference images and ground measurements from an integrated, multi-scale remote sensing experiment. A traditional LSMM with fixed endmembers and the Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) model were also used for model performance comparison. The results showed that the R-2 and RMSE values between the FVC estimated from the proposed model and the UAV reference were 0.7315 and 0.1016 (unitless) respectively, which was better than the results from the linear spectral mixture model with a fixed number of endmembers, with R-2 of 0.5924 and RMSE of 0.3821. The R-2 and RMSE values between the FVC estimated from MESMA and the UAV reference were 0.6327 and 0.1578, which was comparable with the ASLSMM. The accuracy evaluation usingmulti-temporal in situ measurements indicated the consistently high performance of the ASLSMM. This study highlights the feasibility of using HJ satellite constellation images to generate the temporally dense and fine spatial resolution FVC estimations for wetland and wetland-like heterogeneous landscape monitoring. The proposed approach can be viewed as a reference for generating FVC datasets from the on-going HJ constellation and similar constellation missions such as Sentinel-2A/B. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Human-induced bare ground gain accounted for 95% of the total and consisted of the following components: 39% commercial and residential development, 23% resource extraction, 21% infrastructure development, 11% transitional, and 1% greenhouses. East Asia and the Pacific accounted for nearly half of all global bare ground gain area (45%), with China alone accounting for 35% of global gain. The United States was second to China, accounting for 17% of total bare ground gain.

Passive microwave (PM) measurements are sensitive to snow water equivalent (SWE), even in mountain regions, but vegetation masks the microwave signals and reduces this sensitivity. This study examines how the PM snow signal is affected by the forest density in fourteen basins in the Sierra Nevada, USA, and in a series of sixteen subsets of the Kern basin that have varied vegetation density. 36.5 GHz vertical polarization brightness temperature (T-b) time series for each basin were produced from the spaceborne AMSR-E operational period (water year (WY) 2003 to WY2011). For each basin, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the annual minimum Tb and the concurrent SWE was calculated to evaluate the sensitivity of the PM to SWE. The relationship between the R-2 values and the forest density was then analyzed to assess how vegetation affect the SWE information in the observed Tb. Mean forest coverage from MODIS was used to represent forest density. The R2 between the annual minimum Tb and concurrent SWE was >0.6 for three of the basins. Consistent with previous studies, WY2006 demonstrated anomalous Tb values for many basins, apparently due to anomalous warm winter rainfall. Excluding WY2006, R-2 is significantly higher in all basins: eight of fourteen basins have R-2 >0.6. For basins with average elevation >2500 m, SWE correlates well with Tb. The R-2 decreases monotonically with decreasing elevation. Basin elevation and forest cover are highly correlated in the Sierra; a basin elevation of 2500 m generally coincides with forest cover of 20%. A total of 42% of Sierra Nevada has <20% forest cover; this corresponds to an estimated 34% of the total SWE in the Sierra. Thus, SWE and Tb are empirically correlated for over a third of the SWE in the Sierra, typically at high elevations and above treeline. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

With Fresnel formula of polarization as the foundation, this paper studies three important factors that influence the BPDF: shadow, slope distribution and NDVI, and proposes a new BPDF model (named as XieCheng model for convenience in comparison) for urban areas. Because the influence of slope distribution is trivial, only two parameters are needed in the new model, one controlling the shadow and the other for overall scale. An experimental factor is introduced into the model to compensate the influence of NDVI for polarized reflectance more accurately. Experiments prove that new model performs best in both correlation and RMSE for measurements not only with different urban places around the world but also clustered urban data by different NDVIs. Compared with the best current BPDF model, new model can reduce the average RMSE error by about 4.5% for different urban areas. Error distribution in polar coordinates also shows that new model can achieve smallest errors in almost all directions under fixed sun zenith angle. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose was to re-evaluate the role of PRI as an indicator of seasonally shifting pigment (chlorophyll, carotenoid and anthocyanin) contents, and hence photosynthetic activity, across a range of tree and crop species. We studied natural vegetation - three tree species (maple, chestnut and beech) and two managed irrigated and rainfed crop species (maize and soybean), contrasting in photosynthetic pathway and leaf structure, and having wide variation of pigment content and composition. In anthocyanin-free leaves, PRI related to both total chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid (Car) contents, however, much closer relationships were found between PRI and Car to Chl ratio (Car/Chl). The sensitivity of PRI to Car/Chl varied widely in tree species with the degree of secondary carotenoids. In crop leaves where the Car vs. Chl relationship was very close, the slopes of PRI vs. Car/Chl relationships for maize and soybean were almost identical. PRI vs. Car/Chl relationships for leaves of different tree species formed a significant, uniform relationship with PRI. Two crops also formed a significant, uniform PRI vs. Car/Chl relationship with a slope half the value found for trees. In anthocyanin-containing leaves, PRI did not clearly relate to any pigment content because reflectance values at both PRI wavebands are affected by anthocyanin content. The findings of a strong link between leaf level PRI and Car/Chl over seasonal and ontogenetic time spans supports recent findings calling for a more careful evaluation of the relationship between PRI and either LUE or photosynthetic activity. In particular, studies that contrast short-term (e.g. diurnal) vs. long-term (e.g. seasonal) pigment, PRI, and photosynthetic responses in contrasting vegetation types are needed.

These measurements have provided important information on the response of the cryopshere (Earth\'s frozen surfaces) to changes in atmosphere and ocean condition. ICESat operated from 2003 to 2009 and provided repeat altimetry measurements not only to the cryosphere scientific community but also to the ocean, terrestrial and atmospheric scientific communities. The conclusive assessment of significant ongoing rapid changes in the Earth\'s ice cover, in part supported by ICESat observations, has strengthened the need for sustained, high accuracy, repeat observations similar to what was provided by the ICESat mission. Following recommendations from the National Research Council for an ICESat follow-on mission, the ICESat-2 mission is now under development for planned launch in 2018. The primary scientific aims of the ICESat-2 mission are to continue measurements of sea ice freeboard and ice sheet elevation to determine their changes at scales from outlet glaciers to the entire ice sheet, and from 105 of meters to the entire polar oceans for sea ice freeboard. ICESat carried a single beam profiling laser altimeter that produced similar to 70 m diameter footprints on the surface of the Earth at similar to 150 m along-track intervals. In contrast, ICESat-2 will operate with three pairs of beams, each pair separated by about 3 km cross-track with a pair spacing of 90 m. Each of the beams will have a nominal 17 m diameter footprint with an along -track sampling interval of 0.7 m. The differences in the ICESat-2 measurement concept are a result of overcoming some limitations associated with the approach used in the ICESat mission. The beam pair configuration of ICESat-2 allows for the determination of local cross -track slope, a significant factor in measuring elevation change for the outlet glaciers surrounding the Greenland and Antarctica coasts. The multiple beam pairs also provide improved spatial coverage. The dense spatial sampling eliminates along -track measurement gaps, and the small footprint diameter is especially useful for sea surface height measurements in the often narrow leads needed for sea ice freeboard and ice thickness retrievals. The ICESat-2 instrumentation concept uses a low energy 532 nm (green) laser in conjunction with single-photon sensitive detectors to measure range. Combining ICESat-2 data with altimetry data collected since the start of the ICESat mission in 2003, such as Operation IceBridge and ESA\'s CryoSat-2, will yield a 15+ year record of changes in ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness. ICESat-2 will also provide information of mountain glacier and ice cap elevations changes, land and vegetation heights, inland water elevations, sea surface heights, and cloud layering and optical thickness.

Characterizing the spatiotemporal flood dynamics, such as surface water and changes in subsequent vegetation growth vigour and biomass, is essential in better understanding of ecology and hydrology of these regions. Recent remotely sensed flooding studies of arid zone floodplains have concentrated on improving classification of surface water, particularly in mixed water-vegetation areas; less is known about the effect of surface water flooding pattern on emergent vegetation dynamics. We use an integrated framework for mapping both flood extents and the persistence of floodplain response changes of water, vegetation and moisture in Cooper Creek, Australia. We analysed pixel-based time series of multiple indices generated by daily MODIS data for 14 highly variable flow flood events between 2000 and 2012. Results indicate that for the extremely flat Cooper Creek floodplain, mapping inundation area by changes in vegetation growth vigour and biomass was significantly larger than surface water mapping area (16.2% for the 2004 flood event) and the difference in inundation mapping mainly occurs around the inundated edges. In addition, by studying surface water and subsequent vegetation response together, it is possible to generate new information, such as the lag time between flooding and peak vegetation growth vigour and biomass, and persistence time of surface water and green vegetation, which provide important insights to arid zone floodplain behaviour. The large extent and high frequency of MODIS images provide advantages in characterizing inundation dynamics for large-scale floodplains where instantaneous (daily) inundation extent is considerably smaller than total cumulative inundation extent, compared with sensors with higher spatial resolution but lower temporal resolution; however, the coarse resolution of MODIS (500 m) limits its performance for small flood events. Globally, this approach is suitable for other large, low-gradient floodplains in arid zones that show similar, long duration vegetation responses as observed in Cooper Creek.(C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Several recent studies have demonstrated the strong link between GPP and space-borne retrievals of SIF at broad scales. However, critical gaps remain between short-term small-scale mechanistic understanding and seasonal global observations. Here, we present a model-based analysis of the relationship between SIF and GPP across scales for diverse vegetation types and a range of meteorological conditions, with the ultimate focus on reproducing the environmental conditions during remote sensing measurements. The coupled fluorescence-photosynthesis model SCOPE is used to simulate GPP and SIF at the both leaf and canopy levels for 13 flux sites. Analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of temporal scaling, canopy structure, overpass time, and spectral domain on the relationship between SIF and GPP. The simulated SIF is highly non-linear with GPP at the leaf level and instantaneous time scale and tends to linearize when scaling to the canopy level and daily to seasonal. These relationships are consistent across a wide range of vegetation types. The relationship between SIF and GPP is primarily driven by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), especially at the seasonal scale, although the photosynthetic efficiency also contributes to strengthen the link between them. The linearization of their relationship from leaf to canopy and averaging over time is because the overall conditions of the canopy fall within the range of the linear responses of GPP and SIF to light and the photosynthetic capacity. Our results further show that the top-of-canopy relationships between simulated SIF and GPP have similar linearity regardless of whether we used the morning or midday satellite overpass times. Field measurements confirmed these findings. In addition, the simulated red SIF at 685 nm has a similar relationship with GPP as that of far-red SIF at 740 nm at the canopy level. These findings provide model-based evidence to interpret remotely sensed SIF data and their relationship with GPP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The existing PROSPECT model and its concept of a compact leaf are used as a starting point, and the differential equations for radiative transfer within the leaf are solved by an efficient doubling algorithm. Due to the simplicity of these equations, Fluspect offers a high computational speed. With incident light provided as the main input parameter, Fluspect calculates the emission of ChIF on both the illuminated and shaded side of the leaf. Other input parameters are chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations, leaf water, dry matter and senescent material (brown pigments) content, leaf mesophyll structure parameter and ChIF quantum efficiency for the two photosystems, PS-I and PS-II. We investigated the model performance using measurements of leaf reflectance, transmittance and ChIF spectra, collected for barley and sugar beet leaves in both a laboratory and outdoors setting. The plants had been grown under various illumination conditions to increase between-leaf variability of leaf biochemical and structural properties. We retrieved the model parameters, compared them to corresponding destructive measurements and finally, used them to simulate ChIF on either side of the leaf at several light intensities. The results show that the model reproduces observed SIF accurately, especially for leaves measured under natural illumination. Most of the observed between-leaf variability of ChIF could be explained from differences in leaf biochemical and structural properties, with potential additional information held by ChIF emission efficiency parameters.

Utilizing the topographic information we proposed a coupling parameter based atmospheric correction method or CPBAC for short. This method firstly establishes the radiative transfer equations using the data of objects with good Lambertian properties under various topographical positions, and then calculates the coupling parameters of atmosphere and topography and finally accomplishes both the atmospheric and topographic correction simultaneously using those parameters. To validate it, the Landsat 7 multispectral data about one region in Cody Town of Wyoming, USA which was acquired in different seasons was used to do a comparison with the commonly used FLAASH and QUAC methods. The comparison revealed that the CPBAC method can effectively achieve atmospheric correction with its result similar to that produced by either FLAASH or QUAC, and the topography caused spectral radiation difference among the objects of the same type was eliminated by showing an increased spectral consistency and a decreased relevance between radiometric information and topography. Although the assumptions which the CPBAC method is based upon impose restrictions on its widespread use, it can achieve the best effect when it is applied to handle the data containing objects of good Lambertian properties located in different terrains, and the selected pixels for the parameters calculation are various combinations of those with small slope and small sun zenith angle.

And about half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions stay in the atmosphere, the remainder is taken up by the biosphere. It is of paramount importance to better understand CO2 sources and sinks and their spatio-temporal distribution. In the context of climate change this information is needed to improve the projections of future trends in carbon sinks and sources. Since the terrestrial carbon and water cycles are tightly coupled by biological plant processes, i.e. through the stomatal gas exchange with the atmosphere, it is expected that information on the soil moisture state will help to constrain terrestrial carbon fluxes. In the present feasibility study we employ the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System CCDAS to pioneer the assimilation of the SMOS L3 soil moisture product together with another biophysical data set in this case atmospheric CO2 flask samples. The two data streams are assimilated into a process-based model of the terrestrial carbon cycle over two years. CCDAS aims to optimise model process parameters and subsequently land surface CO2 exchange fluxes. We find that the assimilation of SMOS data improves the agreement with independent soil moisture data from the active ASCAT instrument. In both cases the assimilation also improves the fit of modelled atmospheric CO2 to the observations at flask sampling sites which have not been used in the assimilation. Reduction of uncertainty relative to the prior is generally high for both regional net ecosystem productivity and net primary productivity and considerably higher than for assimilating CO2 only, which quantifies the added value of SMOS observations as a constraint on the terrestrial carbon cycle. The study demonstrates a high potential for a SMOS L4 carbon flux product. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Scholze, M.; Knorr, W.; Grant, J.

However the relationship between photosynthetic rate and these measurements is complicated by several factors that relate to the dissipation of absorbed light energy via both photochemical (photosynthesis) and non-photochemical pathways. Numerical simulations of physiological remote sensing signals require the coupling of physically-based radiative transfer models with models of physiological dynamics. These schemes provide the quantitative frameworks from which physiological information can be extracted from remote sensing observations of vegetation, helping to resolve the aforementioned complexities. We present such a framework that links physiological fluorescence theory with spectral remote sensing type measurements at the leaf scale. We show how a simple expression can be used to predict the quantum yield of photochemistry (Phi(PSII)), a proxy for photosynthetic efficiency, from spectral measurements and modelled non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). We tested two alternate models of NPQ; one process-based (PHOTOII) and the other empirical, based on visible region reflectance changes (the PRI). We used a Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) model to retrieve the separated yields of chlorophyll fluorescence from photo systems II and I. Measurements of dynamic spectral fluorescence, the PRI, hemispherical reflectance and transmittance, saturation pulse integrated fluorescence and pigment contents were collected from maple leaves and used to calibrate and validate the modelling framework. Both NPQ models reproduced the observed photochemical and non-photochemical dynamics. Future work is recommended to scale the framework across space, time and species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Most of the existing ALS-based algorithms for individual tree delineation from the point cloud are top-down, which are accurate for delineating cone-shaped conifers, but have lower delineation accuracies over more structurally complex broad-leaf forests. Therefore, in this study we developed a new bottom-up algorithm for detecting trunks and delineating individual trees with complex shapes, such as eucalypts. Experiments were conducted in the largest river red gum forest in the world, located in the southeast of Australia, that experienced severe dieback over the past six decades. For detection of individual tree trunks, we used a novel approach based on conditional Euclidean distance clustering that takes advantage of spacing between laser returns. Overall, the algorithm developed in our study was able to detect up to 67% of field-measured trees with diameter larger than or equal to 13 cm. By filtering ALS based on the intensity, return number and returned pulse width values, we were able to differentiate between woody and leaf tree components, thus improving the accuracy of tree trunk detections by 5% as compared to non-filtered ALS. The detected trunks were used to seed random walks on graph algorithm for tree crown delineation. The accuracy of tree crown delineation for different ALS point cloud densities was assessed in terms of tree height and crown width and resulted in up to 68% of field-measured trees being correctly delineated. The double increase in point density from similar to 12 points/m(2) to similar to 24 points/m(2) resulted in tree trunk detection increase of 11% (from 56% to 67%) and percentage of correctly delineated crowns increase of 13% (from 55% to 68%). Our results confirm an algorithm that can be used to accurately delineate individual trees with complex structures (e.g. eucalypts and other broad leaves) and highlight the importance of full-waveform ALS for individual tree delineation.

Mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of insect disturbance dynamics can help in understanding their impacts on forest ecosystem resilience and functioning, and in developing adaptive management strategies. In recent years, much progress has been made in landscape-level analyses of insect-induced disturbances using remotely sensed data. However, many studies have focused on single insect agents or aggregated different insect agents into a single group. In this study, we characterized the temporal-spectral patterns associated with bark beetle and defoliator disturbances using Landsat time series between 1990 and 2013, with the objective to test if the two insect disturbances can be separated with Landsat data. We analyzed a recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura freemani Razowski) in British Columbia, Canada. To characterize the disturbance and recovery trends associated with insect disturbances we used the LandTrendr segmentation algorithm. We fitted LandTrendr spectral trajectories to annual normalized burn ratio (NBR) and Tasseled Cap (TC) time series, from which we then extracted a set of disturbance metrics. With these disturbance metrics, two random forest models were trained to a) distinguish insect disturbances from harvest and fire disturbances; and to b) attribute the insect disturbances to the most likely agent, i.e. mountain pine beetle or western spruce budworm. Insect disturbances were successfully mapped with an overall accuracy of 76.8%, and agents were successfully attributed with overall accuracies ranging from 75.3% to 88.0%, depending on whether only pure host-stands or mixed stands with both insect hosts were considered. In the case of mixed host stands, nearly 45% of the western spruce budworm disturbances were falsely attributed to mountain pine beetle. Spectral metrics describing disturbance magnitude were more important for distinguishing the two insect agents than the disturbance duration. Spectral changes associated with western spruce budworm disturbances had generally lower magnitudes than mountain pine beetle disturbances. Moreover, disturbances by western spruce budworm were more strongly associated with changes in TC greenness, whereas disturbances by mountain pine beetle were more strongly associated with changes in TC brightness and wetness. The results reflect the ephemeral nature of defoliators versus the tree mortality impacts of bark beetles in our study area. This study demonstrates the potential of Landsat time series for mapping bark beetle and defoliator disturbances at the agent level and highlights the need for distinguishing between the two insect agents to adequately capture their impacts on ecosystem processes.

The empirical equations for measurement uncertainties are determined with respect to interferometric coherence for individual and stacked MAI interferograms. An assessment of the 3D components of deformation was performed as well, and RMS errors of 0.75, 0.83, and 0.68 cm were estimated in the east, north, and up directions. A performance test of magma source model parameter estimations was carried out by using the InSAR and 3D measurements. From the 3D deformation field, we found that the magma chamber source at the Kilauea caldera should be modeled by the spheroid source rather than the simple point source. The performance comparison between the InSAR and 3D modeled results showed that the 3D deformation field allows for precise model parameter estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The goal of this study was to model total Chl and N concentration at the landscape-scale from remotely sensed data utilizing a model insensitive to plant functional type (PFT), species and season. To date the relationship between spectral reflectance and foliar properties is poorly understood in peatlands owing to the scarcity of studies examining the spectral variability between mosses and vascular plants. A model that comprised a continuous wavelet transform coupled with a neural network was constructed to predict Chl and N content from selected wavelet features (coefficients) at both leaf and airborne image scales. The model was compared to thirteen common spectral indices used to determine vegetation properties in forest environments. The heterogeneity of the vascular plant/moss cover over small spatial scales (<1 m) and the spectral complexity of the vegetation cover, precluded a regression model to be derived from the spectral indices for all species across seasons; the best model for all species combined was R-2 = 0.3. The final continuous wavelet model resulted in a noticeable improvement with R-2 values ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 (for both Chl and N content). We scaled up our predictive model from the leaf/capitulum level data to 40 cm spatial resolution 72-band airborne imagery (CASI-2 429.6-968.8 nm) to create surfaces of Chi and N content for the study area.

The study area is located about 20 km east of Rome (Italy) and is characterised by relevant groundwater exploitation for various purposes as well as by the presence of compressible soils immediately below the ground level. Extensive processing at different scales of SAR satellite images (ERS and ENVISAT provided by ESA in the frame of a CAT-1 project) by means of A-DInSAR technique was performed. The time histories of ground displacements, have been analysed in combination with a detailed geological setting of the study area and with the hydrogeological changes occurred in the last decades (as the response to the anthropic stress) based on a large piezometric dataset. This comprehensive dataset allowed us to describe the space and time distributions of the subsidence process. The spatial pattern and deformation rate change is attributed to the following causes: i) the changes in the groundwater levels due to the intensification of mine exploitation (requiring dewatering operations) and ii) the distribution and thickness of recent compressible deposits. Specifically, it is derived that the groundwater level variations drive the timing of subsidence triggering over the area, whereas the local geological conditions control the magnitude of the deformation process.

The spatial distribution of the GSV across four ecological zones (polar, boreal, temperate, subtropical) was well captured by the ASAR-based estimates. The uncertainty of the retrieved GSV was smallest in boreal and temperate forest (<30% for approximately 80% of the forest area) and largest in subtropical forest. ASAR-derived GSV averages at the level of administrative units were mostly in agreement with inventory-derived estimates. Underestimation occurred in regions of very high GSV (>300 m(3)/ha) and fragmented forest landscapes.

In this study, we attempt to map the spatial structure of the sea surface temperature (SST) signature of the Leeuwin Current using MODIS satellite data, which is used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current for the period July 2002 to December 2012. A topographic Position Index (TPI) method is used to map the Leeuwin Current\'s SST signature from the MODIS SST images. The semi-automatic classification process involves automatically identifying areas occupied by warm SST waters of the Leeuwin Current and manually discarding detached Leeuwin Current features. The TPI mapping results enabled us to quantitatively examine the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current\'s SST signature, including its spatial structure, extent, and cross-shelf migration, as well as its associated surface chlorophyll a characteristics. This study showed that the TPI mapping is able to capture the complex spatial structures of the Leeuwin Current, including its meanders, offshoots and eddies along its path, as reflected in the SST data. Using an eddy-resolving, data-assimilating numerical ocean model, we were able to relate the Leeuwin Current\'s SST signature with its surface current speed signature, though generally the speed signature is on the offshore side of the SST signature by about 25 to 30 km. Temporal wavelet analyses indicated that the variability of the Leeuwin Current\'s SST structure is dominated by seasonal cycle. During austral winter, the warm SST signature of the current is close to the shelf break, having greater spatial extent and higher chlorophyll a concentrations. In contrast, during austral summer, the SST signature of the current moves offshore, with reduced spatial extent and chlorophyll a concentrations. The Leeuwin Current also has notable inter-annual variation, to a large extent in response to ENSO variability in the Pacific. In El Nino years the current\'s SST signature tends to have reduced spatial extent, move further inshore, and increase its chlorophyll a concentrations. The opposite occurs during the La Nina years, especially after the unprecedented 2010-11 La Nina/Ningaloo Nino event when there was a significant reduction of the surface chlorophyll a concentration within the Leeuwin Current\'s SST signature. The mapping method developed in this study will be also useful in detecting climate driven variability of other ocean boundary current systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

PAR represents the amount of solar radiation in the spectral range of 400-700 nm that travels through the atmosphere to the top of the vegetation canopy. In recent years, various methods using different input data to estimate PAR and produce different PAR products have been developed. However, most of the algorithms used in these state-of-the-art studies have not fully compensated for the low spatial and temporal resolution of the data, which affects the accuracy of the PAR estimates. In this study, we have developed a method for estimating hourly PAR based on a combination of geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite data. The Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) was selected to retrieve cloud optical depth (COD) with a higher spatial resolution, and the polar orbit satellite data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products were used to derive surface parameters based on multispectral characteristics. A look-up table was established by the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum-Vector (6SV) model and the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model consisting the following parameters: solar zenith angle, total water vapor, total ozone column, aerosol optical depth (ADD), COD, surface elevation, surface albedo and PAR. The instantaneous PAR was linearly interpolated from the input data for the selected parameters and the look-up table. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the estimated and observed instantaneous PAR at the Huailai station was 45.72 W/m(2) for all sky conditions. The RMSE between the estimated and observed daily PAR at the meteorological stations was 17% in the eastern regions of China. The mean bias error (MBE) was between -2.83 and 32.43 W/m(2) for the Tibetan Plateau. These results indicated that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of PAR estimates and can be used to produce PAR products with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the method requires further improvement, especially with respect to cloudy conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The spatial and temporal variations in the regional AOT over China during 2013 (from 24 January to 31 December) were then firstly investigated using VIIRS aerosol IP data. Evaluation of VIIRS IP AOT with MODIS retrievals and AERONET measurements indicated that the performance of the VIIRS aerosol IP product is comparable to that of their counterparts from the heritage MODIS sensor. However, the VIIRS IP can produce more retrievals than MODIS due to its higher spatial resolution, therefore more suitable for regional AOT study. It was found that the VIIRS IP mean AOT over China differs from that of MODIS by - 0.032 for the collocated retrievals, with a correlation of 0.928. Compared with AERONET measurements, VI1RS IP AOT shows a negative bias of - 0.058 with the standard deviation of the difference of 0.192 over China. Among the 10 typical sites under study, the maximum annual average AOT550 values (with +/- standard deviation) were found in Chengdu (1.07 +/- 032), whereas the lowest annual mean AOT550 values were found in FB1 (0.242 +/- 025). The economically developed regions had high AOT values during all seasons. Based on the distribution of AOT, China can be divided into an economically developed eastern region with high AOT values and less-developed western regions, consistent with the boundary between China\'s second and third terrain regions.

In many geographical regions where ground PM2.5 monitoring is spatially sparse and unsuitable for environmental health inference, satellite remote sensing can potentially be used for estimating human exposure to PM2.5. However, retrieval of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) using the Dark Target (DT) algorithm is uncertain in many regions worldwide (e.g. western USA, the Middle East and central Asia) due to low signal-to-noise ratio as a result of high surface reflectivity in the spectral bands used by the algorithm. In this study we use the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm as well as a combined DB-DT algorithm for AOD retrievals. The AOD products are used to predict ground PM2.5 using mixed effects models and the daily calibration approach. Models for the two study areas (Israel and San Joaquin Valley, Central California) were developed independently and then compared to each other. Using the AOD(DB) within a mixed effects model considerably improved PM2.5 prediction in high reflectance regions, revealing in both study areas enhanced model performance (in terms of both R-2 and the root mean square prediction error), significant increase in the spatiotemporal availability of the AOD product, and improved PM2.5 prediction relative to using AOD(DT) retrievals.

In large parts of the world, real-time ground-based observations of precipitation are sparse and satellite-derived precipitation products are the only information source.   We used changes in satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) and land surface temperature (LST) to reduce uncertainties in the real-time TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis product (TMPA-RT). The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was used to model the response of LST and SM on precipitation, and a particle filter was used to update TMPA-RT. Observations from AMSR-E (LPRM and LSMEM), ASCAT, SMOS and LST from AMSR-E were assimilated to correct TMPA-RT over the continental United States.   Assimilation of satellite-based SM observations alone reduced the false detection of precipitation (by 85.4%) and the uncertainty in the retrieved rainfall volumes (5%). However, a higher number of observed rainfall events were not detected after assimilation (34%), compared to the original TMPA-RT (46%). Noise in the retrieved SM changes resulted in a relatively low potential to reduce uncertainties. Assimilation of LST observations alone increased the rainfall detection rate (by 51%), and annual precipitation totals were closer to ground-based precipitation observations. Combined assimilation of both satellite SM and LST, did not significantly reduce the uncertainties compared to the original TMPA-RT, because of the influence of satellite SM over LST. However, in central United States improvements were found after combined assimilation of SM and LST observations. This study shows the potential for reducing the uncertainties in TMPA-RT estimates over sparsely gauged areas.

The day-night band (DNB) is mounted on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the NPP to greatly improve upon the night time imaging capabilities. In order to cover the wide dynamic radiation range, the Low Gain Stage (LGS), Median Gain Stage (MGS) and High Gain Stage (HGS) are employed to view the earth at daytime, twilight and nighttime respectively. Especially, the radiance measured at night is relatively low, so the radiometric calibration is too difficult to calculate directly. To independently evaluate the radiometric calibration of DNB HGS at night, the vicarious calibration of S-NPP/VIIRS DNB on the basis of the deep convection clouds (DCCs) under lunar illumination is presented. DCCs are selected by applying the spatial homogeneity criteria of brightness temperature and radiance. To determine the macro- and microphysical properties of DCCs at night, the CloudSat-CALIPSO nighttime observation data for 2-year period from January 2009 to December 2010 are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the average of the cloud top heights, cloud base heights, and cloud effective radius are 15 km, 0.9 km and 30 pm separately over tropical area from 2009 to 2010. These properties of DCCs are assumed to be the typical values for DCCs. The top of atmosphere reflectance values of the identified DCC targets at the VIIRS DNB at night are simulated by the promoted radiative transfer model, which combined the lunar irradiance model with the SCIATRAN to realize the radiative transfer simulation at anytime. The comparison between the simulated reflectance values and the corresponding DNB HGS measurements for a 1-year period from August 2012 to July 2013 shows that, on a daily basis, the DNB HGS data are calibrated on orbit within a 4.9% 8.8% uncertainty range near full moon. The vicarious calibration method using DCCs are suggested to be reliably used for DNB HGS radiometric calibration directly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the study was to efficiently utilize both wall-to-wall Landsat data and a sample of LiDAR data using model-assisted estimation. Variables derived from the Landsat 7 ETM + satellite image were spectral values of blue, green, red, near infra-red (IR), and two shortwave IR (SWIR) bands. From the LiDAR data twenty-six height and density based metrics were extracted. Field plots were measured according to a design similar to the 10th Finnish National Forest Inventory, although with an increased number of plots per area unit. The study was performed in a 30000 ha area of Kuortane, Western Finland. Three regression models based on different combinations of auxiliary data were developed, analysed, and applied in the model-assisted estimators. Our results show that adding auxiliary Landsat and LiDAR data improves estimates of growing stock volume. Very precise results were obtained for the case where wall-to-wall Landsat data, LiDAR strip samples, and field plots were combined; for simple random sampling of LiDAR strips the relative standard errors (RSE) were in the range of 1-4%, depending on the size of the sample. With only LiDAR and field data the RSEs ranged from 4% to 25%. We also showed that probability-proportional-to-size sampling of LiDAR strips (utilizing predicted volume from Landsat data as the size variable) led to more precise results than simple random sampling.

Several locations that were experiencing land displacement were identified including Cimahi, Dayeuh Kolot, Rancaekek, Solokan Jeruk and Gedebage. The subsidence rates in the basin range from -240 mm/year to 40 mm/year. The comparison between the ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR measurements, which showed good agreement, suggested the subsidence in many areas of the basin were steady between 2002 and 2011, except south Bandung. Acceleration of subsidence in south Bandung was observed between the measurements from the two datasets, likely as a result of increasing population and industries. The subsidence in the basin was expected mainly as a result of excessive groundwater extraction and soil consolidation caused by surficial loading GPS survey data collected between 2002 and 2010 were used to validate the ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR measurements. Good correlations were observed between InSAR and GPS measurements. The comparison between the land subsidence measurements and the groundwater level information showed there were some correlations between them. For every 1 m reduction in groundwater level per annum, ground subsidence of 20-23 mm per annum has been observed. The comparison results suggested that there was no evidence showing the aquifer in the basin is being recovered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Investigation of the variations of surfaces within dust source regions has the potential to elucidate the processes that control erodibility and to improve model representations of dust emission. In this study, we investigate surface temporal variability in the Black Rock playa (Nevada, USA) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data from between 2004 and 2010. The SAR backscatter (sigma(0)) observations of the playa surface are compared to weather station observations and temporally-resolved measurements of water inundation derived from multi-spectral MODIS satellite data. The data illustrate that centimeter-scale surface roughness on the playa is surprisingly heterogeneous over multi-meter length scales and evolves dynamically on annual time scales. Interannual changes in surface roughness on the playa are quite large compared to the variability of surface roughness during the summer months (July-September), suggesting that summer anthropogenic and aeolian processes are substantially less important than water-related processes for controlling the evolution of the playa surface. Playa median ob is relatively low in years with high annual precipitation (>140 mm), suggesting that surface water controls centimeter-scale surface roughness and, potentially, erodibility. Spatially, there is a relationship between ob and the time of year at which a surface dries. Areas drying in July have significantly higher ob than surfaces that dry earlier in the year, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity in ob is controlled by cycles of wetting and drying at the edge of the playa lake. The implications in the Black Rock playa, and potentially more broadly, are that water is a critical factor controlling playa surface evolution, and the annual time scale is crucial for investigations of playa erodibility.

In particular, space-based fluorescence may provide information on the length of the carbon uptake period. Here, for the first time we test the ability of satellite fluorescence retrievals to track seasonal cycle of photosynthesis as estimated from a diverse set of tower gas exchange measurements from around the world. The satellite fluorescence retrievals are obtained using new observations near the 740 nm emission feature from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) instrument offering the highest temporal and spatial resolution of available global measurements. Because GOME-2 has a large ground footprint (similar to 40 x 80 km(2)) as compared with that of the flux towers and the GOME-2 data require averaging to reduce random errors, we additionally compare with seasonal cycles of upscaled GPP estimated from a machine learning approach averaged over the same temporal and spatial domain as the satellite data surrounding the tower locations. We also examine the seasonality of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (AFAR) estimated from satellite measurements. Finally, to assess whether global vegetation models may benefit from the satellite fluorescence retrievals through validation or additional constraints, we examine seasonal cycles of GPP as produced from an ensemble of vegetation models. Several of the data-driven models rely on satellite reflectance-based vegetation parameters to derive estimates of APAR that are used to compute GPP. For forested (especially deciduous broadleaf and mixed forests) and cropland sites, the GOME-2 fluorescence data track the spring onset and autumn shutoff of photosynthesis as delineated by the upscaled GPP estimates. In contrast the reflectance-based indicators and many of the models, particularly those driven by data, tend to overestimate the length of the photosynthetically-active period for these biomes. Satellite fluorescence measurements therefore show potential for improving the seasonal dependence of photosynthesis simulated by global models at similar spatial scales.

In the case of the Amazon Basin, complexity in sediment pattern distribution is affected by the anabranching channel pattern of the Amazon River, inputs from tributaries (some of which are among the largest rivers on Earth) and the existence of huge and complex floodplains. In this paper, patterns of surface sediment distribution are modeled based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over the Amazon River by estimating surface sediment concentrations. Specifically, we aim to 1) detect the regional and seasonal variability of surface sediment in the main channel, 2) observe the influence of tributaries into the main system, 3) identify channel-floodplain interactions, and 4) investigate the internal variability of surface sediment along the main channel system. Field surface sediment concentration data from three gauging stations representing the upstream, midstream, and downstream sections of the Amazon River between 2000 and 2010 were used to calibrate 1328 MODIS daily surface reflectance images. Robust empirical models were derived between field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data from each station (0.79 < R-2 < 0.92, slopes significant at 99% confidence level) from 752 selected data after quality control. We applied empirical models to 2112 8-day composite surface reflectance images to generate surface sediment distribution maps since 2000. Overall, this study successfully demonstrated the capability of our MODIS-based model to capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface sediments in the Amazon River Basin, the largest river system on Earth.

Offshore wind farms are typically constructed in near-shore, shallow waters. These waters can be highly productive or provide nursery grounds for fish. EU legislation requires assessment of the environmental impact of the wind farms. The effects on hard and soft substrate fauna, seabirds and marine mammals are most frequently considered. Here we present Landsat-8 imagery that reveals the impact of offshore wind farms on suspended sediments. Turbid wakes of individual turbines are observed that are aligned with tidal currents. They are 30-150 m wide, and several km in length. The environmental impact of these wakes and the source of the suspended material are still unclear, but the wake size warrants further study. The underwater light field will be affected by increased suspended sediments and the turbid wakes could significantly impact sediment transport and downstream sedimentation. The question of whether such features can be detected by other remote sensors is addressed by a theoretical analysis of the signal:noise specification for the Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3), the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and by a demonstration of the impact of processing OLI data for different spatial resolutions.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is among the widely used sensors in this field and sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the standard quantities derived from MODIS imagery. However, MODIS SST maps have limited applications in near-shore and coastal environments due to inadequate spatial resolution of 1 km. This problem means that the MODIS pixels closer than 1 km from the shore are mixed pixels, i.e. they include by both water and land, and must be discarded from the SST map. In this work SWTI (Sharpening Water Thermal Imagery) methods were applied to MODIS thermal imagery for the first time. The information required by SWTI regarding cover fractions and perpendicular vegetation index was obtained from the MODIS images in the Visible-Near Infrared bands at a spatial resolution of 250 m. In this way, the SST MODIS maps were extended to a minimum distance of 250 m from the shore. The SWTI results were evaluated using as a reference the SST computed from two ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) images acquired simultaneously to the MODE images and covering the same areas. The applied validation methodology provides an evaluation of the deviations introduced by SWTI separated from the pre-existing differences between MODIS SST and ASTER SST upscaled to 250 m. For sea coast environments, SWTI was able to compute the SST of more than 80% of the pixels close to the shore at a spatial resolution of 250 m. This represents an increase of 67% compared to the number of pixels obtainable using a simple downscaling method based on polynomial interpolation; in areas with lagoons and estuaries the increases were + 70% and + 60% respectively. The ASTER SST comparison showed that the SST bias and the unsystematic deviation introduced by SWTI were Delta(s) <= 0.45 K and sigma(epsilon(S)) <= 0.88 K respectively, corresponding to a total deviation TD <= 0.97 K. SWTI is written in the IDL language and could be adapted for automatic application to MODIS images. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the phenological development of trees, the LAI shows high seasonal variability. This study estimated the LAI through field measurements and satellite-derived spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) in two alluvial forest sites at species level (black alder). The primary objective of this study was the validation of seasonal relationships between field-measured LAI, using a LI-COR 2200 plant canopy analyzer (PCA), and four red edge and non-red edge satellite-derived spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) of 10 high spatial resolution RapidEye images: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the red edge NDVI (NDVI-RE), the modified red edge simple ratio (mSR-RE), and the curvature. The indices were compared using 4 phenological phases (leaf flushing until crown closure, leaf growth under crown closure, decreasing leaf chlorophyll content, and leaf senescence) over the entire vegetation period in 2011 using regression analyses, t-test and root mean square error (RMSE). The results suggest that the LAI-SVI relationships varied seasonally. Strong to weak linear relationships were obtained during different periods. For each phase, a different SW fitted best: NDVI-RE during leaf flushing until crown closure (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 0.47), mSR-RE during leaf growth under crown closure (R-2 = 0.422, RMSE = 0.71), NDVI-RE during decreasing leaf chlorophyll content (R-2 = 0.182, RMSE = 0.58), and NDVI during leaf senescence (R-2 = 0.829, RMSE = 0.53). Thus, implementing the red edge channel improved the LAI-SVI relationships, particularly during periods with few variations in the LAI. An analysis of the entire vegetation period revealed that NDVI had the best regression (R-2 = 0.942, RMSE = 0.507) because it was the most stable index due to moderate LAI values (average max. LAI = 4.63). The satellite-based vegetation indices used in this study provided reliable estimates and described the temporal changes and spatial variability in the LAI well. It can be concluded that a LAI-SVI relation cannot be established by a single linear regression throughout a year. Hence, a multi-temporal approach is recommended when monitoring alluvial forest dynamics. Future research on estimating the LAI based on satellite imagery should include the phenological phases into the calculation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, it is a crucial parameter for interpreting backscatter characteristics of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for agricultural application such as near-surface soil moisture retrieval. SR is typically estimated using manual profiles of height variation along short transects (1 to 3 m). However, this approach can be very time consuming and often only a small number of transects can be measured in this way, which may not be adequate to characterize the spatial variability of SR across the landscape. This study investigated the feasibility of utilising airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)_observations as an alternative for mapping SR attributes across an agricultural environment in New South Wales, Australia. To that end, SR attributes were extracted from airborne LiDAR observations and compared with those extracted from an extensive ground survey of SR making use of manual pin-profilers. Results show that LiDAR-estimates of soil profile surface heights Root Mean Square (RMS) are both accurate (compared to manual profiles) and precise (repeatable stable estimates) for fields presenting bare or fallow conditions and either presenting no row structure or as long as the orientation of the LiDAR scan line is perpendicular to the row structure. In such cases results indicated a strong correlation between LiDAR-estimated and ground-measured RMS estimates (R-2 > 0.68, p <0.05), with an RMSE better than 0.81 cm and bias smaller than 0.48 cm from a 400 m flight altitude. Moreover, estimates produced from repeat pass LiDAR datasets were consistent and highly correlated (R-2 0.98) suggesting that the approach is precise and robust, provided that key tillage parameters (i.e. presence of vegetative material and row direction) can be pre-classified. LiDAR estimates of surface height RMS were shown to be accurate enough to allow the tracking of temporal changes in surface roughness due to farming activities. In contrast, LiDAR-derived surface Correlation Length (CL) estimates were not found to be a reliable proxy of the ground-measured CL. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

As an integral part of the VIIRS sensor calibration and validation efforts, our group has been continuously monitoring the validity of the VIIRS\'s OC and atmospheric data stream through time-series in-situ data acquired at the observatory sites which are part of the AERONET-OC network. This paper addresses the preliminary evaluations of the VIIRS sensor\'s performance for retrieving OC data of typical coastal water environments, by carrying out time-series, as well as qualitative and quantitative match-up comparisons analysis between in-situ and satellite retrieved OC data. Initial time-series match-up comparisons carried out for a year period (January to December, 2012) show that VIIRS data exhibits strong temporal and statistical agreements with AERONET-OC data demonstrating a potential in enhanced coastal water monitoring from space. VIIRS data of two NASA-OBPG processing schemes which apply different vicarious calibration gains and NOAA-IDPS system are analyzed based on in-situ data of LISCO and WaveCIS AERONET-OC sites which are located in Long Island Sound and Gulf of Mexico respectively as well as OC retrievals of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard the Aqua satellite. The underlying cause of the discrepancies observed in VIIRS retrieved normalized water-leaving radiances is also investigated. Finally, as the NASA-OBPG and NOAA-IDPS processing schemes for ocean color data of the VIIRS sensor continue to evolve, the results underline the necessity for monitoring and assessing the validity and consistency of VIIRS\' ocean color products, especially for coastal waters.

Estimation of LAI from satellite data is a challenging and difficult problem. Studies over the past decades have focused predominantly on the improvement of forward modeling of the radiative transfer problem and on the application of more realistic numerical inversion schemes. Little or no attention has been paid to alternatives for the least squares method as a statistical distance measure or cost function, used to minimize the distance between observations and model predictions. The least-squares method has properties that assume noise with a Gaussian distribution and zero mean, an assumption often violated when LAI is estimated from satellite reflectance data. Here, we test the use of alternative statistical distance measures or cost functions to estimate LAI. We combine a look-up table (LUT)-inversion method based on the FLIGHT radiative transfer model and test how well it estimates LA! from MODIS reflectance data for a large set of alternative cost functions. We consider three classes of statistical distance measures or cost functions: information divergence measures, M-estimates, and minimum contrast methods. We estimate LAI from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product (MOD09GA) for 11 VALERI and BigFoot sites around the globe. These sites consist of a wide range of tree-cover types that include conifer, broadleaf and mixed (conifer, broadleaf, grassland) forest sites.

An algorithm was designed to minimize radiometric noise and to retrieve Adelie penguin colony location and spatial extent from the ETM+ data. In all, 9143 individual pixels were classified as belonging to an Adelie penguin colony class out of the entire dataset of 195 ETM+ scenes, where the dimension of each pixel is 30 m by 30 m, and each scene is approximately 180 km by 180 km. Pixel clustering identified a total of 187 individual Adelie penguin colonies, ranging in size from a single pixel (900 m(2)) to a maximum of 875 pixels (0.788 km(2)). Colony retrievals have a very low error of commission, on the order of 1% or less, and the error of omission was estimated to be similar to 3 to 4% by population based on comparisons with direct observations from surveys across east Antarctica. Thus, the Landsat retrievals successfully located Adelie penguin colonies that accounted for similar to 96 to 97% of the regional population used as ground truth. Geographic coordinates and the spatial extent of each colony retrieved from the Landsat data are available publically. Regional analysis found several areas where the Landsat retrievals suggest populations that are significantly larger than published estimates. Six Adelie penguin colonies were found that are believed to be previously unreported in the literature. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Schwaller, Mathew R.] NASA GSFC, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.

Remotely-sensed soil moisture time series of SWI (Soil Water Index) derived from ERS (European Remote Sensing) scatterometers are used to predict groundwater head dynamics in the Rhine-Meuse basin, where over four thousand observed groundwater head time series are available. Our study consists of three evolving research steps. First, the correlation between observed time series of groundwater head and SWI is investigated. Second, SWI time series are used as input to a transfer-function noise (TFN) model for temporal prediction ( forecasts) of groundwater heads. Third, TFN models with spatially interpolated parameters are used with SWI time series for spatio-temporal prediction of groundwater heads. Here, HAND (Height Above Nearest Drainage) as derived from a digital elevation model is used as auxiliaty information. Results show that the correlation between SWI and groundwater head time series is apparent, particularly in areas with shallow groundwater, and that correlation increases when a time-lag is taken into account. Temporal predictions with TFN models reproduce observed groundwater head time series well at locations with shallow groundwater, but results are poor for locations with deep groundwater. The spatio-temporal prediction method is not able to estimate the absolute value of groundwater heads. However, head variation in terms of timing and amplitude is predicted reasonably well, in particular in areas with shallow groundwater. This suggests that, once a groundwater model is suitably calibrated, remotely sensed soil moisture data could be used to improve groundwater prediction in an operational data-assimilation framework.

In a first step, the performances of the MODIS, CYCLOPES, GLOBCARBON and JRC-FAPAR products were reviewed. The MODIS and CYCLOPES products were then selected since they provide higher level of consistency. These products were fused to generate the improved LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER values that were later scaled to closely match their expected range of variation. Finally, neural networks were trained to estimate these fused and scaled products from SPOT-VEGETATION top of canopy directionally normalized reflectance values.

This study examines the potential for use of suites of vegetation indices (VIs) from the proposed Sentinel 2 sensor to describe vegetation states in grasslands and savannas for a North American transect. Hyperion hyperspectral data from the EO-1 satellite were used to simulate Sentinel 2, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) images for field sites in Alberta, North Dakota and Texas that represent the continuum from short grass prairie to oak savanna and are intermingled with agriculture. Indices representing photosynthetic pigments (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Carotenoid Reflectance Index, Anthocyanin Reflectance Index and Red-Green Ratio), vegetation and landscape water content (Normalized Difference Infrared Index), senescent vegetation and soil (Short Wave Infrared Ratio and Plant Senescence Reflectance Index) and herbaceous biomass (Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index) were used. There were distinct differences among sites in the relative sensitivity of different VIs depending upon moisture status, tree cover and type of grassland. Simple multi-variate models based on mean values or VIs showed limited ability to predict land cover classes and nominal vegetation states. However, analysis of sample areas using pixels as individual observations within a statistical distribution indicated that subtle variation and gradients within management or land units could be used to characterize fine differences in selected nominal states at each site. Despite some differences in band locations, all VIs except the anthocyanin reflectance index were scalable between Sentinel 2 and MODIS and VIIRS data. A framework for using suites of VIs as indicators of vegetation states that could be applied to the state and transition model approach-applied by the US Natural Resource Conservation Service is described. Land types can be effectively characterized by pixel value distribution histograms, and statistical metrics may be used as indicators of status and change. However, time series are needed to fully capture states and state changes, since grasslands and savannas have such high levels of spectral and phenological variation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Live FMC (LFMC) is responsive to long term climate and plant adaptations to drought, requiring remote sensing for monitoring of spatial and temporal variations in LFMC. Liquid water has strong absorption features in the near- and shortwave-infrared spectral regions, which provide a physical basis for direct estimation of LFMC. Complexity introduced by biophysical and biochemical properties at leaf and canopy scales presents theoretical and methodological problems that must be addressed before remote sensing can be used for operational monitoring of LFMC. The objective of this paper is to review the use of remotely sensed data for estimating LFMC, with particular concern towards the operational use of LFMC products for fire risk assessment. Relationships between LFMC and fire behavior have been found in fuel ignition experiments and at landscape scales, but the complexity of fire interactions with fuel structure has prevented linking LFMC to fire behavior at intermediate scales. Changes in LFMC have both direct (liquid water absorption) and indirect (pigment and structural changes) impacts on spectral reflectance. The literature is dominated by studies that have used statistical (empirical) and physical model-based methods applied to coarse resolution data covering the visible, near infrared, and/or shortwave infrared regions of the spectrum. Empirical relationships often have the drawback of being site-specific, while the selection and parameterization of physically-based algorithms are far more complex. Challenges remain in quantifying error of remote sensing-based LFMC estimations and linking LFMC to fire behavior and risk. The review concludes with a list of priority areas where advancement is needed to transition remote sensing of LFMC to operational use. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This study presents a comprehensive feasibility analysis of satellite-based permafrost modeling for a typical lowland tundra landscape in the Lena River Delta, Siberia. We assessed the performance of a transient permafrost model which is forced by time series of land surface temperatures (LSTs) and snow water equivalents (SWEs) obtained from MODIS and GlobSnow products. Both the satellite products and the model output were evaluated on the basis of long-term field measurements from the Samoylov permafrost observatory. The model was found to successfully reproduce the evolution of the permafrost temperature and freeze-thaw dynamics when calibrated with ground measurements. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed in order to evaluate the impact of inaccuracies in the model forcing and uncertainties in the parameterization. The sensitivity analysis showed that a correct SWE forcing and parameterization of the snow\'s thermal properties are essential for reliable permafrost modeling. In the worst case, the bias in the modeled permafrost temperatures can amount to 5 degrees C. For the thaw depth, a maximum uncertainty of about +/- 15 cm is found due to possible uncertainties in the soil composition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Many of these methods rely on interpretation of phytoplankton size or type from pigment data, but independent validation has been difficult due to lack of appropriate in situ data on cell size.   This work uses in situ data (photosynthetic pigments concentration and cell abundances) from the north-east Atlantic, along a trophic. gradient, sampled from 2005 to 2010, as well as Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) data for the same region, to test a previously developed conceptual model, which calculates the fractional contributions of pico-, nano- and micro-plankton to total phytoplankton chlorophyll biomass (Brewin et al., 2010). The application of the model proved to be successful, as shown by low mean absolute error between data and model fit. However, regional values obtained for the model parameters had some effect on the relative distribution of size classes as a function of chlorophyll-a, compared with the results according to the original model. The regional parameterisation yielded a dominance of micro-plankton contribution for chlorophyll-a concentrations greater than 0.5 mg m(-3), rather than from 1.3 mg m(-3) in the original model. Intracellular chlorophyll-a (Chla) per cell, for each size class, was computed from the cell enumeration results (microscope counts and flow cytometry) and the chlorophyll-a concentration for that size class given by the model. The median intracellular chlorophyll-a values computed were 0.004, 0.224 and 26.78 pg Chla cell(-1) for pico-, nano-, and micro-plankton respectively. This is generally consistent with the literature, thereby providing an indirect validation of the method based on pigments to assign size classes. Using a satellite-derived composite image of chlorophyll-a for the study area, a map of cell abundance was generated based on the computed intracellular chlorophyll-a for each size-class, thus extending the remote-sensing method for mapping size classes of phytoplankton from chlorophyll-a concentration to mapping cell numbers in each class. The map reveals the ubiquitous presence of pico-plankton, and shows that all size classes are more abundant in more productive areas. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The global mosaics are centered on 1975, 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010, and consist of data acquired from four sensors: Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, Thematic Mapper, Multispectral Scanner, and Advanced Land Imager. The GLS datasets have been widely used in land-cover and land-use change studies at local, regional, and global scales. This study evaluates the GLS datasets with respect to their spatial coverage, temporal consistency, geodetic accuracy, radiometric calibration consistency, image completeness, extent of cloud contamination, and residual gaps. In general, the three latest GLS datasets are of a better quality than the GLS-1990 and GLS-1975 datasets, with most of the imagery (85%) having cloud cover of less than 10%, the acquisition years clustered much more tightly around their target years, better co-registration relative to GLS-2000, and better radiometric absolute calibration. Probably, the most significant impediment to scientific use of the datasets is the variability of image phenology (i.e., acquisition day of year). This paper provides end-users with an assessment of the quality of the GLS datasets for specific applications, and where possible, suggestions for mitigating their deficiencies.

This paper describes a new radiative transfer model (FovMod) to simulate the DBT of the row crop canopy by considering the sensor\'s footprint in the ground measurements. The FovMod firstly divides the sensor\'s circular or elliptical footprint into a few small cells, and then estimates the components\' fractions (e.g., leaves, sunlit soil and shaded soil) in each cell based on the gap probability theory. The canopy\'s DBT is finally obtained by weighting the components\' brightness temperatures and their fractions using a Gaussian point spreading function (PSF) of the sensor\'s response. Simulation results indicate that a small footprint causes the distribution of the DBT to be strongly dominated by the row direction and a single component\'s temperature but little influenced by the solar position. On the contrary, a large footprint smoothes the row-space effect and causes the DBT to distribute as a uniform, continuous canopy. Comparison with a previous parallel model shows that if the diameter of the sensor\'s circular footprint extends to 1.5-2.0 times as large as the total width of the row crop canopy, the footprint effect is minimized, and the ground measured DBT can, theoretically, be used to evaluate the parallel model with negligible error. Finally, validations with a maize canopy demonstrated that the new model performed more accurately than the parallel model to simulate the DBT. Moreover, the FovMod also provides an opportunity to assess the measurement uncertainty caused by some unexpected changes in the sensor\'s footprint. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In general, Tbs and MLSEs are found to be negatively correlated to SM. Their dependences on the vegetation water content (VWC) are not monotonic: positive correlations at relatively low VWC and negative correlations at high VWC range. Although Amazon dense rainforest is the most stable vegetation regime, there are significant seasonal variations in both MLSE and Tbs, with amplitudes of about 0.025 and 7.0 K, respectively. The day-to-day variation of MLSE and Tbs is larger in the wet seasons than in the dry seasons, although the mean MLSE and Tbs are lower in the wet seasons than in the dry seasons. After precipitation, the SM, VWC and canopy interception water increase and reach their peak values at different transit times. There is an equilibrium time point (about 4 h in this case) at which the vegetation soil system holds the largest amount of moisture. Consequently, Tbs and MLSEs decrease during the first several hours after the start of precipitation and then increase after the equilibrium time point Ignoring the \"turning point\" may introduce significant errors in the estimation of MLSEs (up to 0.04) and Tbs (up to 10 K) under rainy conditions.

Rapid changes in institutional and socio-economic conditions, such as the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, often trigger widespread LULCC Yet, it is unclear how effective protected areas are in safeguarding habitat within them during such periods of rapid LULCC. Our goal here was to map changes in forest cover and agricultural lands from 1984 to 2010 in order to assess the effectiveness of two strictly protected areas, Olcsky and Mordovsky State Nature Reserves, in temperate European Russia. We analyzed dense time series of Landsat images for three Landsat footprints and applied a support vector machine classification and trajectory-based change detection to map forest disturbance. We then used matching statistics to quantify the effectiveness of the protected areas. Our analyses highlighted considerable post-Soviet LULCC in European Russia. The LULCC maps revealed disturbances on 5.02% of the total forest area, with strongly declining disturbance rates in post-Soviet times. We also found that 39.89% of the agricultural land used in 1988 was abandoned after 1991, leading to widespread forest regrowth. Oksky and Mordovsky State Nature Reserves had a significantly lower probability of forest disturbance (-0.1 to -3.5% lower) in comparison to their surrounding areas. This suggests that protected areas were relatively effective in limiting human-induced forest disturbance in European Russia, despite lower levels of control and an eroding infrastructure for nature protection. Moreover, we found drastic land-cover changes, particularly forest regrowth, in the surroundings of these protected areas, highlighting conservation opportunities. Protected areas can play a key role in biodiversity conservation during periods of rapid LULCC, and remote sensing coupled with matching statistics provide important tools for monitoring the success and failure of conservation efforts.

Because land cover affects and is affected by climate change, it is listed among the 13 terrestrial essential climate variables. This paper describes the generation of a land cover map for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) for the year 2008. It was developed in the framework of the project Latin American Network for Monitoring and Studying of Natural Resources (SERENA), which has been developed within the GOFC-GOLD Latin American network of remote sensing and forest fires (RedLaTIF). The SERENA land cover map for LAC integrates: I) the local expertise of SERENA network members to generate the training and validation data, 2) a methodology for land cover mapping based on decision trees using MODIS time series, and 3) class membership estimates to account for pixel heterogeneity issues. The discrete SERENA land cover product, derived from class memberships, yields an overall accuracy of 84% and includes an additional layer representing the estimated per-pixel confidence. The study demonstrates in detail the use of class memberships to better estimate the area of scarce classes with a scattered spatial distribution. The land cover map is already available as a printed wall map and will be released in digital format in the near future. The SERENA land cover map was produced with a legend and classification strategy similar to that used by the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS) to generate a land cover map of the North American continent, that will allow to combine both maps to generate consistent data across America facilitating continental monitoring and modeling.

Optical remote sensing data can be used to detect seasonal CWC variation but whether they are sensitive enough for detecting diurnal CWC variation remains unknown. This paper investigates whether MODIS/ASTER airborne simulator (MASTER) data can be used to detect diurnal variation in CWC over well irrigated almond and pistachio orchards in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California, USA. MASTER images were first corrected for the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effect to remove cross-track variation in reflectance amplitude. Two spectral indexes, the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were derived from corrected morning and afternoon MASTER imagery and related to the field-measured CWC. At the ground level, a significant decrease (similar to 9%) in CWC occurred from morning to afternoon (p<0.0001). The field-measured CWC was positively correlated with MASTER-derived NDII and NDVI for both morning (NDII: r(2)=0.67, NDVI: r(2)=0.56, p<0.0001)and afternoon (NDII: r(2)=0.42, NDVI: r(2)=039, p<0.001) data. The diurnal change in CWC also led to a statistically significant spectral change that was observed as a 4% decline in NDII (p<0.005) or 2% decline in NDVI (p<0.0005). Our results show that the diurnal variation in CWC can be detected for the irrigated orchards using simple spectral indexes derived from MASTER data, with higher sensitivity for NDII than for NDVI as expected. The results also demonstrate the potential for remote sensing to improve crop management and better understand plant physiological changes at field to regional scales. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Existing remote sensing techniques to measure biochemical properties of vegetation, such as Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT), are limited by an inability to differentiate canopy and understorey properties and are influenced by variations in canopy structure. By providing a range-resolved estimate of reflectance, laser scanner measurements have the potential to overcome these limitations. Dual-wavelength laser scanning can provide an active measurement of reflectance from which spectral indices can be derived that are insensitive to range, incidence angle and scattering area of the target within the laser beam, factors that make exploiting single-wavelength laser scanner intensity data difficult.   This study demonstrates the potential of dual-wavelength laser scanning for measurement of leaf biochemical properties, through determining the relationship between a laser-scanner-derived spectral index, using near infrared (1063 nm) and middle infrared (1545 nm) wavelengths, and the EWT of individual leaves. The suitability and sensitivity of the index is tested using a leaf optical properties model (PROSPECT-5) and the method is tested experimentally under laboratory conditions using the Salford Advanced Laser Canopy Analyser. A strong relationship (R-2=0.8, RMSE=0.0069 gcm(-2)) was found between a normalised ratio of the two wavelengths and measured EWT of leaf samples. The relationship corresponds well to that predicted by modelling. However, the experimental data also revealed significant spatial variability in the index value across individual leaves, suggesting heterogeneity in moisture distribution at within-leaf scales. The study suggests significant potential for using dual-wavelength and multispectral laser scanning for measuring-vegetation biochemical properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

For larger geographical regions such as counties, states or nations, it is not feasible to collect airborne LiDAR data continuously (\"wall-to-wall\") over the entire area of interest. Two-stage cluster survey designs have therefore been demonstrated by which LiDAR data are collected along selected individual flight-lines treated as clusters and with ground plots sampled along these LiDAR swaths. Recently, analytical AGB estimators and associated variance estimators that quantify the sampling variability have been proposed. Empirical studies employing these estimators have shown a seemingly equal or even larger uncertainty of the AGB estimates obtained with extensive use of LiDAR data to support the estimation as compared to pure field-based estimates employing estimators appropriate under simple random sampling (SRS). However, comparison of uncertainty estimates under SRS and sophisticated two-stage designs is complicated by large differences in the designs and assumptions. In this study, probability-based principles to estimation and inference were followed. We assumed designs of a field sample and a LiDAR-assisted survey of Hedmark County (HC) (27,390 km(2)), Norway, considered to be more comparable than those assumed in previous studies. The field sample consisted of 659 systematically distributed National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots and the airborne scanning LiDAR data were collected along 53 parallel flight-lines flown over the NFI plots. We compared AGB estimates based on the field survey only assuming SRS against corresponding estimates assuming two-phase (double) sampling with LiDAR and employing model-assisted estimators. We also compared AGB estimates based on the field survey only assuming two-stage sampling (the NFI plots being grouped in clusters) against corresponding estimates assuming two-stage sampling with the LiDAR and employing model-assisted estimators. For each of the two comparisons, the standard errors of the AGB estimates were consistently lower for the LiDAR-assisted designs. The overall reduction of the standard errors in the LiDAR-assisted estimation was around 40-60% compared to the pure field survey. We conclude that the previously proposed two-stage model-assisted estimators are inappropriate for surveys with unequal lengths of the LiDAR flight-lines and new estimators are needed. Some options for design of LiDAR-assisted sample surveys under REDD are also discussed, which capitalize on the flexibility offered when the field survey is designed as an integrated part of the overall survey design as opposed to previous LiDAR-assisted sample surveys in the boreal and temperate zones which have been restricted by the current design of an existing NFT.

In order to be effectively employed, remote-sensing based cover maps must be accurate and meet the spatial scale inherent to the phenomena of interest. In this study, we employed the Random Forests algorithm in a supervised classification approach to construct a fine-scale (i.e., 1.0 meter pixel resolution) remote-sensing based cover map of coastal dune and salt marsh ecosystems at Cape Cod National Seashore, USA. We achieved high overall classification accuracies (i.e., 75.1% and 86.8% correct classification rate for the dune and salt marsh study areas, respectively) with a large proportion of the misclassified holdout validation assessment points being errors of commission between overlapping and/or ecologically similar cover classes. In addition, we were able to considerably reduce the predictor variable set by using a forward selection variable reduction method while achieving modestly higher classification accuracies compared to the global model. Our results suggest that coastal dune and salt marsh ecosystems can be mapped at a fine spatial resolution with reasonably high classification accuracy using a supervised Random Forests-based approach such as ours.

Spaceborne passive microwave (PM) remote sensing has spatially continuous coverage, but coarse spatial resolution. PM spatial footprints are nominally elliptical, with the spatial orientation changing relative to a given basin on the ground from one satellite pass to the next. The widely used Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) resamples the raw PM observations to a 25 km x 25 km grid; this is far coarser than The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) 37 GHz Level 2A (L2A) footprints with an area of 87.9 km(2). This paper presents methods for processing the L2A data in order to illustrate that PM measurements contain information about snow accumulation and ablation cycles in mountainous regions. Methods are presented 1) to calculate the average T-b over a hydrologic basin for monitoring SWE accumulation amount, and 2) to interpolate T-b to a point for monitoring SWE ablation timing. Across the six-year study period, the range of the T-b was 50 K. while the range of the air temperature was only 30 K, indicating significant surface emissivity variations. The minimum T-b of each water year (WY), which starts from October 1 of a calendar year and ends at September 30 of the next, showed a strong inverse relationship to SWE measured in situ; the correlation coefficient between T-b and an in situ basin average SWE was -0.94. The L2A data is three times more sensitive to than the EASE-Grid data to in situ SWE. The diurnal amplitude variability (DAV, or difference between daytime and nighttime T-b) was used to identify the day of melt onset and compared with in situ estimates of onset derived from daily SWE measurements. L2A data corresponded well with the in situ onset dates with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 and an RMSE of 5.04 days. When using EASE-Grid data, the RMSE in onset date was 11.7 days. In addition, T-b DAV was found to be correlated with T-air DAV during winter, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.72. Future work will explore methods to extract this information in order to improve estimates of snow accumulation and ablation patterns. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-one beaches and their offshore areas in southern Florida used by three sea turtle species (Caretta caretta, Chelonia mydas, and Dermochelys coriacea) were compared using topographic measures derived from LiDAR data. Variables such as slope, aspect, rugosity, and topographic and bathymetric position indices (TPI and BPI) were extracted from the LiDAR surface raster to characterize beaches used by sea turtles; stepwise multiple regression was used to determine which variables are most strongly associated with turtle nesting density. The three species exhibited tolerances for similar ranges of values in measured variables; beaches with values outside these tolerances were not used for nesting. Beach nesting density can be successfully modeled for all three species, but different topographic measures were important in each model. This work demonstrates the potential of high spatial resolution topographic datasets to successfully characterize coastal habitat for ecological applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In order to overcome current key validation issues from the spatial scaling mismatch between the ground measurements (point scale) and the AMSR-E soil moisture products (25 km scale), a synergistic approach from 25 to 1 km spatial resolution was performed using auxiliary data from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The 25 km VUA-NASA AMSR-E soil moisture data had error statistics (biases = -0.099 to -0.170 m(3) m(-3), root-mean-squared error = 0.131 to 0.179 m(3) m(-3), and correlation coefficients = 0.127 to 0.725) that were worse than the suggested goal of accuracy (less than or equal to root-mean-squared error of 0.06 m(3) m(-3)) determined by the several previous validation studies. This deficiency is theoretically due to the spatial scaling mismatch and different measurement depth between the ground measurements and the VUA-NASA AMSR-E soil moisture products. The disaggregated 1 km soil moisture was reasonably similar to the 25 km VUA-NASA AMSR-E soil moisture at spatial and temporal scales with better error statistics (biases = -0.024 to -0.158 m(3) m(-3), root-mean-squared error = 0.059 to 0.171 m(3) m(-3), and correlation coefficients = 0.348 to 0.658). Although additional studies are needed under a range of field conditions, the synergistic approach used in this study appears to be a feasible method to improve the spatial distributions of VUA-NASA AMSR-E soil moisture products as well as future microwave soil moisture products.

To assess the environmental impacts of exurban development (e.g., habitat fragmentation, threats to wildlife, and increased demand for natural resources), accurate maps of its spatial extent and change over time are needed. Mapping technologies that are based on remote sensing spectral data alone have generally failed to separate exurban development from the surrounding landscape and from other mixed pixels with similar spectra. Although deciduous forests in the eastern United States are thought to have experienced a significant increase in exurbanized area, a rigorous assessment of exurban trends has yet to be undertaken. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel analytic approach to map exurban development and to assess its magnitude and rate in north-central Virginia and western Maryland. We applied spectral mixture analysis to Landsat TM images from 1986 to 2009 at 4 time steps to estimate the fractional cover of vegetation, shade, substrate, and non-photosynthetic vegetation endmembers within each image. Using training data based on aerial photos, we classified the resulting endmember fraction images using a decision tree. Finally, terminal nodes from the decision tree that did not differentiate between exurban and urban areas were analyzed using morphological spatial pattern analysis to assess the shape and form of landscape elements. Scattered, isolated pixels were considered representative of exurban development. Overall classification accuracies ranged from 93 to 98%, an improvement of up to 34% over the decision tree alone. Our mapping approach effectively identified 7.3% of north-central Virginia and western Maryland as exurban development. Exurban development had a substantial expansion in the region, increasing on average 6.1% per year between 1986 and 2009. The mapping of land-cover changes beyond urban fringe provides valuable information for policymakers, planners, and land managers tasked with managing and mitigating the potential adverse consequences of this increasingly common form of landscape change.

Clarity is an indicator of other water quality variables including chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus and trophic status; however, unlike these metrics, clarity can be accurately and efficiently estimated remotely on a regional scale. Remote sensing is useful in regions containing a large number of lakes that are cost prohibitive to monitor regularly using traditional field methods. Field-assessed lakes generally are easily accessible and may represent a spatially irregular, non-random sample of a region. We developed a remote monitoring program for Maine lakes >8 ha (1511 lakes) to supplement existing field monitoring programs. We combined Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) brightness values for TM bands 1 (blue) and 3 (red) to estimate water clarity (secchi disk depth) during 1990-2010. Although similar procedures have been applied to Minnesota and Wisconsin lakes, neither state incorporates physical lake variables or watershed characteristics that potentially affect clarity into their models. Average lake depth consistently improved model fitness, and the proportion of wetland area in lake watersheds also explained variability in clarity in some cases. Nine regression models predicted water clarity (R-2=0.69-0.90) during 1990-2010, with separate models for eastern (TM path 11; four models) and western Maine (TM path 12; five models that captured differences in topography and landscape disturbance. Average absolute difference between model-estimated and observed secchi depth ranged 0.65-1.03 m. Eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes consistently were estimated more accurately than oligotrophic lakes. Our results show that TM bands 1 and 3 can be used to estimate regional lake water clarity outside the Great Lakes Region and that the accuracy of estimates is improved with additional model variables that reflect physical lake characteristics and watershed conditions.

The level of water stress is taken into account in the calculation of sensible heat, through a modified definition of kB(-1), the parameter that summarizes the excess aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer compared to momentum transfer. Surface energy balance models are employed to obtain evapotranspiration as the remainder of available energy minus sensible heat flux (H). These models assume that information on the ratio of actual to potential evaporation is implicitly embedded in the land surface temperature. This assumption is usually adequate where available energy is the limiting factor for evapotranspiration (ET), but there is a problem when water availability becomes limiting for ET. In this case, the daily evapotranspiration is often overestimated, in particular for sparsely vegetated semi-arid regions, because of an underestimation of sensible heat flux for these areas. Our method remedies this shortcoming by progressively decreasing kB(-1) with increasing levels of water stress. This decreases aerodynamic resistance, and hence increases H, leading to lower estimates of ET. The decrease of kB(-1) with a rise in plant water stress is based on general plant physiological observations related to vertical canopy stomatal conductance profiles, which affects the exchange of sensible and latent heat between the canopy and the atmosphere.   The new approach was tested by comparing SEBS H outputs with field observations from Bowen ratio stations distributed over the Konya basin in Turkey, and the results indicate a large improvement when the soil moisture is integrated explicitly in the calculation of sensible heat flux by SEBS. More importantly, the new approach provides a considerable operational improvement for regional ET mapping through integrating microwave soil moisture measurements into SEBS, as illustrated by our findings for this semi-arid region. The daily ET map generated by the new SEBS model captured better the low ET values observed in the drylands, and also reflected better the overall contrast between irrigated fields and the extremely dry surrounding areas. Improved mapping of regional ET by soil moisture integrated SEBS offers the opportunity to provide more accurate estimation of energy and water fluxes in regions where plant water stress is a recurrent feature.

We applied a temporal change classification of 37 GHz brightness temperature (T-b) series from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) to classify daily FT status over global land areas where seasonal frozen temperatures influence ecosystem processes. A temporally consistent, long-term (30 year) FT record was created, ensuring cross-sensor consistency through pixel-wise adjustment of the SMMR T-b record based on empirical analyses of overlapping SMMR and SSM/I measurements. The resulting FT record showed mean annual spatial classification accuracies of 91 (+/-8.6) and 84 ( +/-9.3) percent for PM and AM overpass retrievals relative to in situ air temperature measurements from the global weather station network. The FT results were compared against other measures of biosphere activity including CO2 eddy flux tower measurements and satellite (MODIS) vegetation greenness (NDVI). The FT defined non-frozen season largely bounds the period of active vegetation growth and net ecosystem CO2 uptake for tower sites representing major biomes. Earlier spring thawing and longer non-frozen seasons generally benefit vegetation growth inferred from NDVI spring and summer growth anomalies where the non-frozen season is less than approximately 6 months, with greater benefits at higher (>45 degrees N) latitudes. A strong (P<0.001) increasing (0.189 days yr(-1)) trend in the Northern Hemisphere mean annual non-frozen season is largely driven by an earlier (-0.149 days yr(-1)) spring thaw trend and coincides with a 0.033 degrees C yr(-1) regional warming trend. The FT record also shows a positive (0.199 days yr(-1)) trend in the number of transitional (AM frozen and PM non-frozen) frost days, which coincide with reduced vegetation productivity inferred from tower CO2 and MODIS NDVI measurements. The relative benefits of earlier and longer non-frozen seasons for vegetation growth under global warming may be declining due to opposing increases in disturbance, drought and frost damage related impacts.

Earlier versions of this global coverage 15-day composite dataset have been used for numerous local to global scale vegetation time series studies during recent years. However, several aspects of the AVHRR sensor design and data processing potentially introduce substantial noise into the NDVI dataset if not corrected for. The more recent NDVI dataset from Terra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is considered an improvement over AVHRR data and with the release of GIMMS3g an overlapping period of 11 years now provides a possibility to perform a robust evaluation of the accuracy of GIMMS3g data and derived trends. In this study the accuracy is evaluated by comparison with the global Terra MODIS NDVI (MOD13C2 Collection 5) data using linear regression trend analysis. The trends of GIMMS NDVI were found to be in overall acceptable agreement with MODIS NDVI data. A significant trend in NDVI (alpha=0.05) was found for 11.8% of the MODIS NDVI pixels on a global scale (5.4% characterised by positive trends and 6.3 with negative trends) whereas GIMMS NDVI analysis produced a total of 10.5% significant pixels (4.9% positive, 5.6% negative). However, larger differences were found for the Southern Hemisphere land masses (South America and Australia) and the high northern latitude Arctic regions. From a linear regression analysis the correlation coefficient between the two datasets was found to be highly significant for areas with a distinct phenological cycle. Discrepancies between the GIMMS and MODIS datasets were found in equatorial areas (broadleaved, evergreen forest), Arctic areas (sparse herbaceous or sparse shrub cover) and arid areas (herbaceous cover, closed-open). Linear regression of QA filtered Terra and Aqua MODIS NDVI (2003-2010) revealed similar inconsistencies for Arctic and equatorial areas suggesting that robust long-term NDVI trend estimates in these areas are difficult to obtain from both GIMMS and MODIS data. Additionally, GIMMS based NDVI trend analysis in arid areas of limited photosynthetic activity should be interpreted with caution. The regression coefficient (slope value) (p<0.01) was found to be close to 1 for most land cover types on a global scale (global land cover class average slope = 1.00) suggesting overall compatibility between MODIS and GIMMS NDVI, but with land cover class specific variations (within class and between classes).

Capturing the many forest harvest and insect defoliation events occurring over twenty-five years, we transformed a series of Landsat images into cumulative disturbance maps covering Green Ridge State Forest (GRSF) and Savage River State Forest (SRSF) in western Maryland. These maps summed yearly Delta DI images, which were defined as the change in a yearly tasseled cap disturbance index (DI), relative to a synthetic reference condition map created by finding the minimum DI value for all years. Intensive field-plot surveys and AVIRIS imagery collected during the summer of 2009 provided measurements of forest structure and canopy nitrogen. With these data, we found that while the most recent year\'s Delta DI had little relation, increases in the cumulative DI were related to decreased field-measured current canopy cover (R-2= 0.66 at GRSF, 0.67 at SRSF and 0.34 combined) and watershed-averaged AVIRIS canopy N (R-2= 0.40 at GRSF, 0.57 at SRSF and 0.54 combined). The latter relationship was obscured at the field-plot level of analysis, suggesting that fine scale studies will also need to account for other drivers (e.g. species composition) of variability in canopy N. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates that Landsat time series data can be synthesized into cumulative metrics incorporating multiple disturbance types, which help explain important cumulative disturbance-mediated changes in ecosystem functioning.

Impervious surface data is important for urban planning and environmental and resources management. Therefore, remote sensing of impervious surfaces in the urban areas has recently attracted unprecedented attention. In this paper, various digital remote sensing approaches to extract and estimate impervious surfaces will be examined. Discussions will focus on the mapping requirements of urban impervious surfaces. In particular, the impacts of spatial, geometric, spectral, and temporal resolutions on the estimation and mapping will be addressed, so will be the selection of an appropriate estimation method based on remotely sensed data characteristics. This literature review suggests that major approaches over the past decade include pixel-based (image classification, regression, etc.), sub-pixel based (linear spectral unmixing, imperviousness as the complement of vegetation fraction etc.), object-oriented algorithms, and artificial neural networks. Techniques, such as data/image fusion, expert systems, and contextual classification methods, have also been explored. The majority of research efforts have been made for mapping urban landscapes at various scales and on the spatial resolution requirements of such mapping. In contrast, there is less interest in spectral and geometric properties of impervious surfaces. More researches are also needed to better understand temporal resolution, change and evolution of impervious surfaces over time, and temporal requirements for urban mapping. It is suggested that the models, methods, and image analysis algorithms in urban remote sensing have been largely developed for the imagery of medium resolution (10-100 m). The advent of high spatial resolution satellite images, spaceborne hyperspectral images, and LiDAR data is stimulating new research idea, and is driving the future research trends with new models and algorithms.

Estimates of aerosol coarse/fine mode classification where tau>02 show 71% correspondence over land and 81% over ocean. Monthly AOD from MODIS, MISR and AATSR showed close agreement over most regions. However, over deserts AATSR estimates were higher than MODIS or MISR, while over southern oceans both AATSR and MODIS were lower than MISR. Global composites show aerosol sources of desert dust, anthropogenic pollution, biomass burning, and their transport. Aerosol radiative forcing is a major source of uncertainty in climate modelling; this newly derived dataset gives spatially and temporally comprehensive fields of aerosol properties suitable to constrain global models and to analyse regional and global trends.

This is due to the dynamic nature of Antarctic pack ice, its microwave signature, the tendency for SAR swath paths to be poorly aligned with the often narrow sea ice zone around the continent and inadequate satellite sampling. A semi-automated system, known as IPADS (IMCORR [IMageCORRelationj Processing, Analysis and Display System), has been developed to map fast ice and pack ice in Antarctica using multiple pairs of SAR images. The software processing pipeline uses overlapping image pairs which are geocoded and roughly registered using only data contained in the image headers. Next, fast ice maps are rapidly generated using zero motion features located within ocean regions. This also provides precise image registration. Finally, the same image pairs are re-examined for pack ice motion in a slower off-line batch process. The pack and fast ice are identified using a cluster-based search method which compares both location and motion information. Each image pair generates a NetCDF file which adds to a growing database of Antarctic sea ice motion and ice roughness. Five image-pair examples are presented to illustrate the methods used as well as their strengths and limitations. Substantial pack ice motion can often be detected in the marginal ice zone on SAR images only a few days apart. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Giles, A. B.; Massom, R.

Pixel-level classification accuracies using this imagery were good (overall accuracy of 87%, kappa = 0.84), although misclassification occurred between a) sunlit crowns of live (green) trees and herbaceous vegetation, and b) sunlit crowns of gray- and red-attack trees and bare soil. We explored the capability of coarser resolution imagery, aggregated from the 30-cm resolution to 1.2, 2.4, and 4.2 m, to improve classification accuracy. We found the highest accuracy at the 2.4-m resolution, where reduction in omission and commission errors and increases in overall accuracy (90%) and kappa (0.88) were achieved, and visual inspection indicated improved mapping. Pixels at this resolution included more shadow in forested regions than pixels in finer resolution imagery, thereby reducing forest canopy reflectance and allowing improved separation between forest and non-forest classes, yet were fine enough to resolve individual tree crowns better than the 4.2-m imagery. Our results illustrate that a classification of an image with a spatial resolution similar to the area of a tree crown outperforms that of finer and coarser resolution imagery for mapping tree mortality and non-forest classes. We also demonstrate that multispectral imagery can be used to separate multiple postoutbreak attack stages (i.e., red-attack and gray-attack) from other classes in the image. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Better biomass estimates may be possible if suitable processing techniques for these sensors can be demonstrated. This research investigates the potential of high resolution optical data from the ALOS AVNIR-2 sensor for biomass estimation in a mountainous, subtropical forested region using four different types of image processing techniques including i) spectral reflectance and simple spectral band ratio, ii) commonly used vegetation indices, iii) texture parameters and iv) ratio of texture parameters. Simple linear and stepwise multiple regression models were developed between biomass data from 50 field plots, and image parameters derived from these techniques.   Results indicate that spectral reflectance, the simple band ratio, and commonly used vegetation indices have relatively low potential for biomass estimation, as only about 58% of the variability in the field data was explained by the model (adjusted r(2) = 0.58 and RMSE = 64 t/ha). However, the texture parameters of spectral bands were found to be effective for biomass estimation with an explained variability of ca. 76% (adjusted r(2) = 0.76 and RMSE=46 t/ha). The result was further improved to adjusted r(2) = 0.88 (RMSE = 32 t/ha) using the simple ratio of texture parameters. The results suggest that the performance of biomass estimation can be improved significantly using the texture parameters of high resolution optical data, and further improvement can be obtained using the ratio of texture parameters, as this combines the advantages of both texture and ratio.

Using airborne hyperspectral (Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer; AVIRIS) and multispectral (MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator: MASTER) data acquired simultaneously over the 2008 Indians Fire in California, we examined changes in modeled fire temperature and fractional area that occurred when input wavelength regions were varied. Temperature and fractional area modeled from multiple MASTER runs were directly compared. Incompatible spatial resolutions prevented direct comparison of the AVIRIS and MASTER model runs, so total area modeled at each temperature was used to indirectly compare temperature and fractional area retrieved from these two sensors. AVIRIS and MASTER model runs using shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands produced consistent fire temperatures and fractional areas when modeled temperatures exceeded 800 K. Temperatures and fire fractional areas were poorly correlated for temperatures below 800 K and when the SWIR bands were excluded as model inputs. The single temperature blackbody assumption commonly used in mixing model retrieval of fire temperature is potentially useful for modeling higher temperature fires, but is likely not valid for lower temperature smoldering combustion due to mixed radiance from multiple fuel elements combusting at different temperatures. SWIR data contain limited emitted radiance from combustion at lower temperatures, and are thus essential for consistent modeling of fire temperature and fractional area at higher fire temperatures.

However, there are few studies that assess the capability of remote sensing observations to monitor ecosystem phenology along elevation gradients, despite their relevance under climate change. We investigated the potential of medium resolution remotely sensed data to monitor the elevation variations in the seasonal dynamics of a temperate deciduous broadleaf forested ecosystem. Further, we explored the impact of elevation on the onset of spring leafing. This study was based on the analysis of multi-annual time-series of VEGETATION data acquired over the French Pyrenees Mountain Region (FPMR), in conjunction with simultaneous ground-based observations of leaf phenology made for two dominant tree species in the region (oak and beech). The seasonal variations in the perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) were analyzed during a five-year period (2002 to 2006). The five years of data were averaged into a one sole year in order to fill the numerous large spatio-temporal gaps due to cloud and snow presence frequent in mountains - without altering the temporal resolution. Since a VEGETATION pixel (1 km(2)) includes several types of land cover, the broadleaf forest-specific seasonal dynamics of PVI was reconstructed pixel-by-pixel using a temporal unmixing method based on a non-parametric statistical approach. The spatial pattern of the seasonal response of PVI was clearly consistent with the relief. Nevertheless the elevational or geographic range of tree species, which differ in their phenology sensitivity to temperature, also has a significant impact on this pattern. The reduction in the growing season length with elevation was clearly observable from the delay in the increase of PVI in spring and from the advance of its decrease in the fall. The elevation variations in leaf flushing timing were estimated from the temporal change in PVI in spring over the study area. They were found to be consistent with those measured in situ (R2>0.95). It was deduced that, over FPMR, the mean delay of leaf flushing timing for every 100 m increase in elevation was estimated be approximately 2.3 days. The expected estimation error of satellite-based leaf unfolding date for a given elevation was approximately 2 days. This accuracy can be considered as satisfactory since it would allow us to detect changes in leafing timing of deciduous broadleaf forests with a magnitude equivalent to that due to an elevation variation of 100 m (2.3 days on average), or in other words, to that caused by a variation in the mean annual air temperature of 0.5 degrees C. Although averaging the VEGETATION data over five years led to a loss of interannual information, it was found to be a robust approach to characterise the elevation variations in spring leafing and its long-term trends.

We present a methodology that may prove useful for a very broad range of forest management applications, particularly for timber inventory evaluation and forest growth modelling. In this study, we use LiDAR data to stratify a multilayered eucalyptus forest and characterise the structure of specific vegetation layers for forest hydrology research, as vegetation dynamics influence a catchment\'s streamflow yield. A forest stand\'s crown height, density, depth, and closure, influence aerodynamic properties of the forest structure and the amount of transpiring leaf area, which in turn determine evapotranspiration rates. We present a methodology that produces canopy profile indices of understorey and overstorey vegetation using mixture models with a wide range of theoretical distribution functions. Mixture models provide a mechanism to summarise complex canopy attributes into a short list of parameters that can be empirically analysed against stand characteristics.   Few studies have explored theoretical distribution functions to represent the vertical profile of vegetation structure in LiDAR data. All prior studies have focused on a Weibull distribution function, which is unimodal. In a complex native forest ecosystem, the form of the distribution of LiDAR points may be highly variable between forest types and age classes. We compared 44 probability distributions within a two component mixture model to determine the most suitable bimodal distributions for representing LiDAR density estimates of Mountain Ash forests in south-eastern Australia. An elimination procedure identified eleven candidate distributions for representing the eucalyptus component of the mixture model.   We demonstrate the methodology on a sample of plots to predict overstorey stand volumes and basal area, and understorey basal area of 18-, 37-, and 70-year old Mountain Ash forest with variable density classes. The 70-year old forest has been subjected to a range of treatments including: thinning of the eucalyptus layer with two distinct retention rates, removal of the understorey, and clear felling of patches that have 37 year old regenerating forest. We demonstrate that the methodology has clear potential, as observed versus predicted values of eucalyptus basal area and stand volume were highly correlated, with bootstrap based r(2) ranging from 0.61 to 0.89 and 0.67 to 0.88 respectively. Non-eucalyptus basal area r(2) ranged from 0.5 to 0.91. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The spatial and temporal resolutions of these aerosol products (10 km and 2 measurements per day for MODIS, similar to 25 km and observation intervals of 15 min for SEVIRI) permit an evaluation of PM estimation from space at different spatial and temporal scales. Different empirical linear relationships between coincident AOD and PM10 observations are evaluated at 13 ground-based PM measurement sites, with the assumption that aerosols are vertically homogeneously distributed below the planetary Boundary Layer Height (BLH). The BLH and Relative Humidity (RH) variability are assessed, as well as their impact on the parameterization. The BLH has a strong influence on the correlation of daily and hourly time series, whilst RH effects are less clear and smaller in magnitude. Despite its lower spatial resolution and AOD accuracy, SEVIRI shows higher correlations than MODIS (r(SEV)similar to 0.7, r(MOD)similar to 0.6) with regard to daily averaged PM10. Advantages from MODIS arise only at hourly time scales in mountainous locations but lower correlations were found for both sensors at this time scale (r similar to 0.45). Moreover, the fraction of days in 2008 with at least one satellite observation was 27% for SEVIRI and 17% for MODIS. These results suggest that the frequency of observations plays an important role in PM monitoring, while higher spatial resolution does not generally improve the PM estimation. Ground-based Sun Photometer (SP) measurements are used to validate the satellite-based AOD in the study region and to discuss the impact of aerosols\' micro-physical properties in the empirical models. A lower error limit of 30 to 60% in the PM10 assessment from space is estimated in the study area as a result of AOD uncertainties, variability of aerosols properties and the heterogeneity of ground measurement sites. It is concluded that SEVIRI has a similar capacity to map PM as sensors on board polar-orbiting platforms, with the advantage of a higher number of observations. However, the accuracy represents a serious limitation to the applicability of satellites for ground PM mapping, especially in mountainous areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To improve the spatial resolution of similar to 40 km resolution passive microwave-derived soil moisture, a methodology based on 1 km resolution MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) red, near-infrared and thermal-infrared data has been implemented at 4 km resolution. The three components of that method are (i) fractional vegetation cover, (ii) soil evaporative efficiency (defined as the ratio of actual to potential evaporation) and (iii) a downscaling relationship. In this paper, 36 different disaggregation algorithms are built from 3 fractional vegetation cover formulations, 3 soil evaporative efficiency models, and 4 downscaling relationships. All algorithms differ with regard to the representation of the nonlinear relationship between microwave-derived soil moisture and optical-derived soil evaporative efficiency. Airborne L-band data collected over an Australian agricultural area are used to both generate similar to 40 km resolution microwave pixels and verify disaggregation results at 4 km resolution. Among the 36 disaggregation algorithms, one is identified as being more robust (insensitive to soil, vegetation and atmospheric variables) than the others with a mean slope between MODIS-disaggregated and L-band derived soil moisture of 0.94. The robustness of that algorithm is notably assessed by comparing the disaggregation results obtained using composited (averaged) Terra and Aqua MODIS data, and using data from Terra and Aqua separately.

No significant relationship was found between lineament yield and incidence angle of Radarsat-1 images. while lineament spatial distribution was in good agreement with the land use and geology of the study area. The high scores observed for NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE orientations match the results of local lineament studies of the region. Radarsat-1 image acquired on May 01, 2001 offers the greatest potential, due to the reduced effect of vegetation during this region\'s dry season Potential hydro-geological lineaments were mapped using the weighting of well location, presence of green vegetation during the dry season, preferential lineament orientations and presence of cross-points The mapping revealed five classes (Very low, Low, Moderate, High and Very high) of potential hydro-geological lineaments with high and very high potential poorly represented. Results also reveal that most wells are far enough from lineaments or cross-points and hence the inefficiency of existing drilling programs.

Ecosystemic approaches, such as the one presented here, address ecosystem maturity or resilience. They are low cost, not very prone to error propagation and well-suited to implementation on remotely sensed time-series data covering large areas. The purposes of this work were to develop a land condition surveillance methodology based on the amount of biomass produced per unit rainfall, and to test it on the Iberian Peninsula.   In this article, we propose parallel and complementary synchronic assessment and diachronic monitoring procedures to overcome the paradox of monitoring as a sequence of assessments. This is intrinsically contradictory when dealing with complex landscape mosaics, as relative estimators commonly produced for assessment are often difficult to set in a meaningful time sequence. Our approach is built on monthly time-series of two types of data, a vegetation density estimator (Green Vegetation Fraction-GVF) derived from Global Environmental Monitoring satellite archives, and corresponding interpolated climate fields. Rain Use Efficiency (RUE) is computed on two time scales to generate assessment classes. This enables detrended comparisons across different climate zones and provides automatic detection of reference areas to obtain relative RUE. The monitoring procedure uses raw GVF change rates over time and aridity in a stepwise regression to generate subclasses of discriminated trends for those drivers. The results of assessment and monitoring are then combined to yield the land condition diagnostics through explicit rules that associate their respective categories.   The approach was tested in the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1989 to 2000 using monthly GVF images derived from the 1-km MEDOKADS archive based on the NOAA-AVHRR sensors, and a corresponding archive of climate variables. The resulting land condition was validated against independent data from the Natura 2000 network of conservation reserves. In very general terms, land was found to be healthier than expected, with localised spots of ongoing degradation that were associated with current or recent intensive land use. Static or positive vegetation growth rates were detected almost everywhere, including Mediterranean areas that had undergone increased aridification during the study period. Interestingly, degrading or static trends prevailed in degraded or unusually degraded land, whereas trends to improve were most represented in land in good or unusually good condition.

In this study, various approaches including daily combination, adjacent temporal deduction, fixed-day combination, flexible multi-day combination, and multi-sensor combination are assessed to remove cloud obscuration while still maintain the temporal and spatial resolutions. The performance of the resultant snow cover maps are quantitatively evaluated against in situ observations at 244 SNOTEL stations over the Pacific Northwest USA during the period of 2006-2008 hydrological years. Results indicate that daily Terra and Aqua MODIS combination and adjacent temporal deduction can reduce cloud obscuration and classification errors although an annual mean of 37% cloud coverage remains. Classification errors in snow-covered months are actually small and tend to underestimate the snow cover. Primary errors of MODIS daily, fixed and flexible multi-day combination products occur during transient months. Flexible multi-day combination is an efficient approach to maintain the balance between temporal resolution and realistic estimation of snow cover extent since it uses two thresholds to control the combination processes. Multi-sensor combinations (daily or multi-day), taking advantage of MODIS high spatial resolution and AMSR-E cloud penetration ability, provide cloud-free products but bring larger image underestimation errors as compared with their MODIS counterparts.

However, these indices do not provide estimates of dry biomass, an important indicator of crop productivity. For estimating crop aboveground dry biomass and yield, this study developed an approach to integrate crop stressors and crop descriptors derived from optical remote sensing data with the Monteith radiation use efficiency model. Multi-temporal remote sensing data were acquired by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager and the Landsat-5/7 Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) sensors to monitor the growth conditions of corn in the 2001 and 2006 growing seasons. The modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) derived from the remote sensing data was used to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(ApAR)). A canopy structure dynamics model was then used to simulate the seasonal variation of f(APAR). Crop water stress was estimated from the near and shortwave infrared reflectance of the Landsat images for a dry period in the 2001 growing season. By estimating leaf chlorophyll content using the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI) in combination with the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), different levels of nitrogen content could be identified. For the two growing seasons, the aboveground dry biomass and yield were linearly related with the cumulative absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) using the Monteith radiation use efficiency model. The cumulative APAR accounted for 96% of the corn aboveground dry biomass variability and 72% of the yield variability. Biomass and yield variability were partly explained by the variations in crop water stress intensity, which was dependent on soil texture. The seasonal radiation use efficiency was stable over the 2 years and was about 3.9 g MJ(-1), with a confidence interval of 0.6 g MJ(-1) at the 95% confidence level. The assimilation of remotely sensed data into the radiation use efficiency model performed well for monitoring dry biomass accumulation and estimating corn yields.

ECOCLIMAP-II is a dual database at I-km resolution that comprises an ecosystem classification and a coherent set of land surface parameters. This new physiographic information (e.g. leaf area index, fractional vegetation cover, albedo and land cover classification), was especially developed in the framework of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) programme in order to support the modelling of land-atmosphere interactions, which stresses the importance of the present study. Criteria for coherence between prevalent land cover classifications and the analysis of time series of the satellite leaf area index (LAI) between 2000 and 2007 constitute the analysis tools for setting up ECOCLIMAP-II. The LAI and inferred fraction of vegetation cover are spatially distributed per land cover unit. The fraction of vegetation cover is handled to split the land surface albedo into vegetation and bare soil albedo components, as is required for a large number of applications. The new ECOCLIMAP-II land cover product is improved with regard to the spatial coherence compared to former version. The reliability of the physiographic details is also confirmed through verification with land cover products at higher resolution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Within the year 2000 growing season, both the MODIS and CYCLOPES datasets recorded on average similar but substantially higher values than the JRC and GLOBCARBON datasets. Among three of the four datasets, a high level of agreement in deciduous broadleaf forests and croplands was observed. Largest disagreement occurred among needleleaf forests and grassland/shrubland. Potential reasons for discrepancies among the datasets include different retrieval methods, use of LAI and land cover, snow effects and others. Findings from this study and other published results suggest that overall, JRC best captures FAPAR over northern Eurasia in the year 2000. However, when considering individual landcover types, any one or more of the four products may be suitable. There exists a real need for more in-situ measurements in this region the lack of such measurements makes evaluation extremely difficult.

In the first step, the solution of a linearized analytical formulation of the radiative transfer equations was found. In the second step, this solution was used to provide the initial values in a non-linear least squares-based method. This effort represents a first step in the construction of a feasible and timely methodology for Venice lagoon water quality monitoring by remote sensing, especially in view of the existing experimental hyperspectral satellite (Hyperion) and the future missions such as PRISMA, EnMap and HyspIRI. The optical properties of the water constituents were assessed on the basis of sea/lagoon campaigns and data from the literature. The water light field was shaped by an analytical formulation of radiative transfer equations and the application of numerical simulations (Hydrolight software). Once the optical properties of the Venice lagoon bio-optical model were validated, the inverse procedure was applied to local radiometric spectra to retrieve concentrations of chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic matter and tripton. The inverse procedure was validated by comparing these concentrations with those measured in the laboratory from in situ water samples, then it was applied to airborne (CAST and MMS) and satellite (Hyperion) sensors to derive water constituent concentration maps. The consistent results encourage the use of this procedure using future missions satellite (PRISMA, EnMap and HyspIRl). (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This debate, however, has been hampered by two problems: 1) it is notoriously time consuming to measure the physiognomy of habitat, particularly in forests, and 2) rigorous statistical methods to predict the composition of bird assemblages from assemblages of plants have not been available. Here we use airborne laser scanning (lidar) to measure the habitat (vegetation) structure of a montane forest across large spatial extents with a very fine grain. Furthermore, we use predictive co-correspondence and canonical correspondence analyses to predict the composition of bird communities from the composition and structure of another community (i.e. plants). By using these new techniques, we show that the physiognomy of the vegetation is a significantly more powerful predictor of the composition of bird assemblages than plant species composition in the field and as well in the shrub/tree layer, both on a level of p<0.001. Our results demonstrate that ecologists should consider remote sensing as a tool to improve the understanding of the variation of bird assemblages in space and time. Particularly in complex habitats, such as forests, lidar is a valuable and comparatively inexpensive tool to characterize the structure of the canopy even across large and rough terrain.

Image compositing is a powerful technique for cloud filtering that often emphasizes cloud clearing at the expense of obtaining synoptic coverage. Although incomplete cloud removal in image compositing is readily apparent, the loss of synopticity, often, is not. Consequently, the primary goal of image compositing should be to obtain the greatest amount of cloud-free coverage or clarity in a period short enough that synopticity, to a significant degree, is preserved.   To illustrate the process of image compositing and the problems associated with it, we selected a region off the coast of California and constructed two 16-day image composites, one, during the spring, and the second, during the summer of 2006, using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) InfraRed (IR) satellite imagery. Based on the results of cloud clearing for these two 16-day sequences, rapid cloud clearing occurred up to day 4 or 5, followed by much slower cloud clearing out to day 16, suggesting an explicit basis for the growth in cloud clearing. By day 16, the cloud clearing had, in most cases, exceeded 95%. Based on these results, a shorter compositing period could have been employed without a significant loss in clarity. A method for establishing an objective basis for selecting the period for image compositing is illustrated using observed data. The loss in synopticity, which, in principle, could be estimated from pattern correlations between the images in the composite, was estimated from a separate time series of SST since the loss of synopticity, in our approach, is only a function of time. The autocorrelation function of the detrended residuals provided the decorrelation time scale and the basis for the decay process, which, together, define the loss of synopticity. The results show that (1) the loss of synopticity and the gain in clarity are inversely related, (2) an objective basis for selecting a compositing period corresponds to the day number where the decay and growth curves for synopticity and clarity intersect, and (3), in this case, the point of intersection occurred 3.2 days into the compositing period. By applying simple mathematics it was shown that the intersection time for the loss in synopticity and the growth in clarity is directly proportional to the initial conditions required to specify the clarity at the beginning of the compositing period, and inversely proportional to the sum of the rates of growth for clarity and the loss in synopticity. Finally, we consider these results to be preliminary in nature, and, as a result, hope that future work will bring forth significant improvements in the approach outlined in this study.

The row model allows calculating the reflectance spectrum in any given direction for the optical spectral region. The performance of the model is evaluated through comparisons with field measurements of winter wheat as well as with an established 3D computer simulation model. Especially the systematic comparisons with the computer simulation model demonstrate that the model can adequately simulate the characteristic distribution of directional reflectance factors of row canopies, which is shown in the polar map of reflectance as a high or low value stripe approximately parallel to the row orientation, besides the hotspot effect. Physical mechanisms causing the dynamics were proposed and supported by comparison studies. The features of reflectance distributions of row canopies, which are distinctively different from those of homogeneous canopy, imply that it is problematic to use one-dimensional radiation transfer model to interpret radiation data and estimate the structural or spectral parameters of row canopies from reflectance measurements. Finally, further improvements needed for the current model are briefly discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The availability of remote sensing data and products, as FAPAR. strongly motivates its use in ecosystem modeling. This paper presents a comparative analysis between MODIS-FAPAR and MERIS-MGVI datasets, two products carrying similar information, from regional (the Iberian Peninsula) to local (six biomes) scales. Moreover, an assessment of the impacts of its use in terrestrial ecosystem modeling, by using the CASA production efficiency model is presented. The analysis was conducted for both datasets for the year 2003, and was supported by an extensive statistical analysis, including geostatistics, focusing both seasonality and spatial coherence. Main findings refer to (i) a systematically higher MODIS than MERIS data. both at the Iberian Peninsula and at local biomes, (ii) a seasonality of the correlation between the two datasets, and (iii) a spatial homogeneity over larger extensions from MERIS-MGVI data, opposing to a higher spatial variability from MODIS-FAPAR. Although these different data properties, it was found that the two independent datasets produce reasonable NEP estimates, by using CASA model at the site level. These results suggest that the MODIS-FAPAR and MERIS-MGVI differences can be minimized in biophysical modeling through model re-parameterization, although this process does not solve the seasonal dependence pattern found in the original datasets.

In this context, studying and monitoring the SUHIs of urban areas through the satellite remote sensing technology, requires land surface temperature (LST) image data from satellite-borne thermal sensors of high spatial resolution as well as temporal resolution. However, due to technical constrains, satellite-bome thermal sensors yield a trade-off between their spatial and temporal resolution; a high spatial resolution is associated with a low temporal resolution and vice versa. To resolve this drawback, we applied in this study four downscaling techniques using different scaling factors to downscale 1-km LST image data provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor, given that AVHRR can offer the highest temporal resolution currently available. The city of Athens in Greece was used as the application site. Downscaled 120-m AVHRR LSTs simulated by the downscaling techniques, were then used for SUHI intensity estimation based on LST differences observed between the main urban land covers of Athens and the city\'s rural background. For the needs of the study, land cover information for Athens was obtained from the Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2000 database for Greece. Validation of the downscaled 120-m AVHRR LSTs as well of the retrieved SUHI intensities was performed by comparative analysis with time-coincident observations of 120-m LST and SUM intensities generated from the band 6 of the Thermal Mapper (TM) sensor onboard the Landsat 5 platform. The spatial pattern of the downscaled AVHRR LST was found to be visually improved when compared to that of the original AVHRR LST and to resemble more that of TM6 LST. Statistical results indicated that, when compared to 120-m TM6 LST, the root mean square error (RMSE) in 120-m AVHRR LST generated by the downscaling techniques ranged from 4.9 to 5.3 degrees C. However, the accuracy in SUM intensity was found to have significantly improved, with a RMSE value decreasing from 2.4 degrees C when the original AVHRR LST was utilized, down to 0.94 degrees C in case that downscaling was applied.

The reflectance ratio is defined as the ratio of the reflectance in a first spectral band, strongly attenuated by O-2 absorption, and the reflectance in a second spectral band, minimally attenuated. For a given surface reflectance, simple relations are established between the reflectance ratio and the altitude of an aerosol layer, as a function of atmospheric conditions and the geometry of observation. The expected accuracy for various aerosol loadings and models is first quantified using an accurate, high spectral resolution, radiative transfer model that fully accounts for interactions between scattering and absorption. The method is developed for POLDER and MERIS, satellite sensors with adequate spectral characteristics. The simulations show that the method is only accurate over dark surfaces when aerosol optical thickness at 765 nm is relatively large (>0.3). In this case, the expected accuracy is on the order of +/- 0.5 km or +/- 0.2 km for POLDER or MERIS respectively. More accurate estimates are obtained with MERIS, since in this case the spectral reflectance ratio is more sensitive to aerosol altitude. However, a precise spectral calibration is needed for MERIS. The methodology is applied to MERIS and POLDER imagery acquired over marine surfaces. The estimated aerosol altitude is compared with in situ lidar profiles of backscattering coefficient measured during the AOPEX-2004 experiment for MERIS, or obtained with the space-borne lidar CALIOP for POLDER. The retrieved altitudes agree with lidar measurements in a manner consistent with theory. These comparisons demonstrate the potential of the differential absorption methodology for obtaining information on aerosol altitude over dark surfaces. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, a cost-effective and time-saving method to determine CWD is not available. Very limited literature could be found that applies remote sensing technique to CWD inventory. In this paper, we fused the wall-to-wall multi-frequency and multi-polarization Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AirSAR) and optical Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to estimate the quantity and quality of CWD in Yellowstone post-fire forest ecosystem, where the severe 1988 fire event resulted in high spatial heterogeneity of dead logs. To relate backscatter values to CWD metrics, we first reduced the terrain effect to remove the interference of topography on AirSAR backscatter. Secondly, we removed the influence of regenerating sapling by quadratic polynomial fitting between AVIRIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and different channels backscatters. The quantity of CWD was derived from P-hh and P-hv, and the quality of CWD was derived from P-hh aided by the ratio of L-hv and P-hh. Two maps of Yellowstone post-fire CWD quantity and quality were produced. The calculated CWD quantity and quality were validated by extensive field surveys. Regarding CWD quantity, the correlation coefficient between measured and predicted CWD is only 0.54 with mean absolute error up to 29.1 t/ha. However, if the CWD quantity was discretely classified into three categories of \"<= 60\", \"60-120\", and \">= 120\", the overall accuracy is 65.6%; if classified into two categories of \"<= 90\" and \">= 90\", the overall accuracy is 73.1%; if classified into two categories of \"<= 60\" and \">= 60\", the overall accuracy is 84.9%. This indicates our attempt to map CWD quantity spatially and continuously achieved partial success; however, the general and discrete categories are reasonable. Regarding CWD quality, the overall accuracy of 5 types (Type 1-standing CWD ratio >= 40%; Type 2-15% <= standing CWD ratio < 40%; Type 3-7% <= standing CWD ratio<15%; Type 4-3% <= standing CWD ratio <7%; Type 5-standing CWD ratio <3%) is only 40.32%. However, when type 1, 2, 3 are combined into one category and type 4 and 5 are combined into one category, the overall accuracy is 67.74%. This indicates the partial success of our initial results to map CWD quality into detailed categories, but the result is acceptable if solely very coarse CWD quality is considered. Bias can be attributed to the complex influence of many factors, such as field survey error, sapling compensation, terrain effect reduction, surface properties, and backscatter mechanism understanding.

Regression analysis dominated previous approaches to the derivation of tree stem and crown parameters from lidar. The regression model for tree parameters is locally applied based on vertical lidar point density the tree species involved, and stand structure in the specific research area. The results of this approach, therefore, are location-specific, limiting its applicability to other areas. For a more widely applicable approach to derive tree parameters, we developed an innovative method called \'wrapped surface reconstruction\' that employs radial basis functions and an isosurface. Utilizing computer graphics, we capture the exact shape of an irregular tree crown of various tree species based on the lidar point cloud and visualize their exact crown formation in three-dimensional space. To validate the tree parameters given by our wrapped surface approach, survey-grade equipment (a total station) was used to measure the crown shape. Four vantage points were established for each of 55 trees to capture whole-tree crown profiles georeferenced with post-processed differential GPS points. The observed tree profiles were linearly interpolated to estimate crown volume. These fieldwork-generated profiles were compared with the wrapped surface to assess goodness of fit For coniferous trees, the following tree crown parameters derived by the wrapped surface method were highly correlated (p<0.05) with the total station-derived measurements: tree height (R-2=0.95), crown width (R-2=0.80), live crown base (R-2=0.92), height of the lowest branch (R-2=0.72), and crown volume (R-2=0.84). For deciduous trees, wrapped surface-derived parameters of tree height (R-2=0.96), crown width (R-2=0.75), live crown base (R-2=0.53), height of the lowest branch (R-2=0.51), and crown volume (R-2=0.89) were correlated with the total station-derived measurements. The wrapped surface technique is less susceptible to errors in estimation of tree parameters because of exact interpolation using the radial basis functions. The effect of diminished energy return causes the low correlation for lowest branches in deciduous trees (R-2=0.51), even though leaf-off lidar data was used. The wrapped surface provides fast and automated detection of micro-scale tree parameters for specific applications in areas such as tree physiology, fire modeling, and forest inventory.

While the surface structure of Rossby waves can be elucidated from comparisons of the signal in different sea surface parameters, models are needed to gain direct information about how these waves affect the ocean at depth. The first three baroclinic modes of the Rossby waves are inferred from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and two-dimensional Radon Transform (2D RT). At many latitudes the first and second baroclinic mode Rossby wave phase speeds from satellite observations and model parameters are identified. Wavelet transforms of these multi-para meters from satellite observations and model simulations help to discriminate between the annual and semi-annual signal of these Rossby waves. This comprehensive study reveals that the surface signature of Rossby waves in SSS anomalies is likely to be between 0.05 and 0.3 psu in the South Indian Ocean. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of lidar data for characterizing forest successional stages across a structurally diverse. mixed-species forest in Northern Idaho. We used a variety of lidar-derived metrics in conjunction with an algorithmic modeling procedure (Random Forests) to classify six stages of three-dimensional forest development and achieved an overall accuracy>95%. The algorithmic model presented herein developed ecologically meaningful classifications based upon lidar metrics quantifying mean vegetation height and canopy cover, among others. This study highlights the utility of lidar data for accurately classifying forest succession in complex, mixed coniferous forests: but further research should be conducted to classify forest successional stages across different forests types. The techniques presented herein can be easily applied to other areas. Furthermore, the final classification map represents a significant advancement for forest succession modeling and wildlife habitat assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate solar surface irradiance data is a prerequisite for an accurate estimation of the radiation budget and for an efficient planning and operation of solar energy systems.   This paper describes a new approach for the retrieval of the solar surface irradiance from satellite data. The method is based on radiative transfer modelling and enables the use of extended information about the atmospheric state. Accurate analysis of the interaction between the atmosphere, surface albedo. transmission and the top of atmosphere albedo has been the basis for the new method, characterised by a combination of parameterisations and \"eigenvector\" look-up tables. The method is characterised by a high computing performance combined with a high accuracy. The performed validation shows that the mean absolute deviation is of the same magnitude as the confidence level of the BSRN (Baseline Surface Radiation Measurement) ground based measurements and significant lower as the CM-SAF (Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility) target accuracy of 10W/m(2) The mean absolute difference between monthly means of ground measurements and satellite based solar surface irradiance is 5 W/m(2) with a mean bias deviation of -1 W/m(2) and a RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) of 5.4 W/m(2) for the investigated European sites. The results for the investigated African sites obtained by comparing instantaneous values are also encouraging. The mean absolute difference is with 2.8% even lower as for the European sites being 3.9%, but the mean bias deviation is with -1.1 % slightly higher as for the European sites, being 0.8%. Validation results over the ocean in the Mediterranean Sea using shipboard data complete the validation. The mean bias is -3.6 W/m(2) and 2.3% respectively. The slightly higher mean bias deviation over ocean is at least partly resulting from inherent differences due to the movement of the ship (shadowing, allocation of satellite pixel). The validation results demonstrate that the high accuracy of the surface solar irradiance is given in different climate regions. The discussed method has also the potential to improve the treatment of radiation processes in climate and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, because of the high accuracy combined with a high computing speed.

Hyperion analysis focused on two datasets acquired from opposite off-nadir viewing directions but similar solar geometry: one acquired on 08 February 2005 (forward scattering) and the other on 14 January 2006 (back scattering). In 2005, the soybean canopies were observed by Hyperion at later reproductive stages than in 2006. Additional Hyperion datasets were not available due to cloud cover. To further examine the impact of viewing geometry within the same season, Hyperion data were complemented by 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images (bands I and 2) acquired in consecutive days (05-06 February 2005) with opposite viewing geometries (-42 degrees and +44 degrees, respectively). MODIS data analysis was used to keep reproductive stage as a constant factor while isolating the impact of viewing geometry. For discrimination purposes, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) was applied over each dataset using surface reflectance values as input variables and a stepwise procedure for band selection. All possible Hyperion band ratios and the 17 narrow-band vegetation indices with soybean grain yield were evaluated across years through Pearson\'s correlation coefficients and linear regression. MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Simple Ratio (SR) were evaluated within the same growing season. Results showed that: (1) the three soybean varieties were discriminated with highest accuracy in the back scattering direction, as deduced from MDA classification results from Hyperion and MODIS data; (2) the highest correlation between Hyperion vegetation indices and soybean yield was observed for the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) (r=+0.74) in the back scattering direction and this result was consistent with band ratio analysis: (3) higher Hyperion correlation results were observed in the back scattering direction when compared to the forward scattering image. For the same reproductive stage, stronger shadowing effects were observed over the MODIS red band in the forward scattering direction producing lower and lesser variable reflectance for the sensor. As a result, the relationship between MODIS-derived NDVI and soybean yield improved from the forward (r of +0.21) to the back scattering view (r of +0.60). The same trend was observed for SIR that increased from +0.22 to +0.58. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Remote sensing offers unique opportunities for detection of forest disturbance at multiple scales: however, spatially and temporally continuous mapping of non-stand replacing disturbance remains challenging. First, most high spatial resolution satellite sensors have relatively broad spectral ranges with bandwidths unsuitable for detection of subtle, stress induced, features in canopy reflectance. Second, directional and background reflectance effects, induced by the interactions between the sun-sensor geometry and the observed canopy surface, make up-scaling of empirically derived relationships between changes in spectral reflectance and vegetation conditions difficult. Using an automated tower based spectroradiometer, we analyse the interactions between canopy level reflectance and different stages of disturbance occurring in a mountain pine beetle infested lodgepole pine stand in northern interior British Columbia, Canada, during the 2007 growing season. Directional reflectance effects were modelled using a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) acquired from high frequency multi-angular spectral observations. Key wavebands for observing changes in directionally corrected canopy spectra were identified using discriminant analysis and highly significant correlations between canopy reflectance and field measured disturbance levels were found for several broad and narrow waveband vegetation indices (for instance, r(NDVI)(2)=0-90: r(CHL3)(2)=0.85; p < 0.05). Results indicate that multi-angular observations are useful for extraction of disturbance related changes in canopy reflectance, in particular the temporally and spectrally dense data detected changes in chlorophyll content well. This study will help guide and inform future efforts to map forest health conditions at landscape and over increasingly coarse scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Three different sets of estimates of its source parameters have already been published. We try to resolve the discrepancies between them by using additional data including two remote sensing satellite systems (ENVISAT and SPOTS). Using a model with a dislocation in an elastic half-space, we constrain the source parameters. The hypothesis of two subevents on distinct faults as inferred from seismological inversions is confirmed here by adopting a cross-fault mechanism. The rupture began on a left-lateral strike-slip fault striking at N10 degrees azimuth with 90 cm of horizontal slip and then transferred to a right-lateral strike-slip fault striking at N312 degrees azimuth with 85 cm of horizontal slip. The first fault is at 500 m depth from the free surface and the second fault is at 3 km depth. This model is consistent with ground-based observations, including GPS, seismology, and mapped surface fissures. The pair of faults activated in 2004 appears to constitute part of a complex seismogenic structure striking NNE-SSW that separates the Rif tectonic blocks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Nine sites across Canada, containing one or more (of 11) distinct species types and age classes at varying stages of regeneration and seasonal phenology were examined using a combination of discrete pulse airborne scanning Light Detection And Ranging (lidar) and coincident analog and digital hemispherical photography (HP). Estimates of WAR were first compared using three methods: PAR radiation sensors, HP, and airborne lidar. HP provided reasonable estimates of WAR when compared with radiation sensors. A simplified fractional canopy cover ratio from lidar based on the number of within canopy returns to the total number of returns was then compared with WAR estimated from HP at 486 geographically registered measurement locations. The return ratio fractional cover method from lidar compared well with HP-derived WAR (coefficient of determination =0.72, RMSE=0.11), despite varying the lidar survey configurations, canopy structural characteristics, seasonal phenologies, and possible slight inaccuracies in location using handheld GPS at some sites. Lidar-derived fractional cover estimates of WAR were similar to 10% larger than those obtained using HP (after removing wood components), indicating that lidar likely provides a more realistic estimate of WAR than HP when compared with radiation sensors. Finally, WAR derived from lidar fractional cover was modelled at 1 m resolution and averaged over 99 1 km areas for comparison with MODIS WAR. The following study is one of the first to scale between plot measurements and MODIS pixels using airborne lidar. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The data set is evaluated both by direct comparisons to ground data and indirectly through inter-comparisons with similar data sets. This indirect validation showed satisfactory agreement with existing LAI products, importantly MODIS, at a range of spatial scales, and significant correlations with key climate variables in areas where temperature and precipitation limit plant growth. The data set successfully reproduced well-documented spatio-temporal trends and inter-annual variations in vegetation activity in the northern latitudes and semi-arid tropics. Comparison with plot scale field measurements over homogeneous vegetation patches indicated a 7% underestimation when all major vegetation types are taken into account. The error in mean values obtained from distributions of AVHRR LAI and high-resolution field LAI maps for different biomes is within 0.5 LAI for six out of the ten selected sites. These validation exercises though limited by the amount of field data, and thus less than comprehensive, indicated satisfactory agreement between the LAI product and field measurements. Overall, the inter-comparison with short-term LAI data sets, evaluation of long term trends with known variations in climate variables, and validation with field measurements together build confidence in the utility of this new 26 year LAI record for long term vegetation monitoring and modeling studies.

A linearity-adjustment factor 13 is proposed and coupled with the soil-adjustment factor L used in the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) to develop EVI2. A global land cover dataset of Terra MODIS data extracted over land community validation and FLUXNET test sites is used to develop the optimal parameter (L, beta and G) values in EVI2 equation and achieve the best similarity between EVI and EVI2. The similarity between the two indices is evaluated and demonstrated with temporal profiles of vegetation dynamics at local and global scales. Our results demonstrate that the differences between EVI and EVI2 are insignificant (within +/- 0.02) over a very large sample of snow/ice-free land cover types, phenologies, and scales when atmospheric influences are insignificant, enabling EVI2 as an acceptable and accurate substitute of EVI. EVI2 can be used for sensors without a blue band, such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and may reveal different vegetation dynamics in comparison with the current AVHRR NDVI dataset. However, cross-sensor continuity relationships for EVI2 remain to be studied. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A modified threshold method was used to detect multiple melt events and the main melt event was identified by the longest melt duration or the largest melt intensity. Algorithm validation was performed with a Circum-Arctic network of station measurements extracted from the Global Surface Summary of Day product maintained by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Estimates of melt onset date corresponded to a clear shift in the statistical distribution of mean daily air temperatures from largely below freezing to above freezing. Melt was not detected in 7% of the cases mainly over dense boreal forest cover, or very shallow tundra snow cover. QSCAT-derived melt end dates were significantly correlated with station-derived snow-off estimates (r(2)= 0.79: RMSE = 11.6 days). The difference between the two estimates was within one week for 70% of the cases so there is good potential to use QSCAT-derived melt end dates to approximate snow-off dates across the pan-Arctic region. There was a tendency for QSCAT-derived snow-off dates to be biased early over dense forest regions due to a diminished backscatter melt signature. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Traditionally, in situ heat flux measures have been used to quantify Such processes, but these typically represent only a small local-scale area within the heterogeneous urban environment. For this reason, remote sensing approaches are very attractive for elucidating more spatially representative information. Here we use hyperspectral imagery from a new airborne sensor, the Operative Modular Imaging Spectrometer (OMIS), along with a survey map and meteorological data, to derive the land cover information and surface parameters required to map spatial variations in turbulent sensible heat flux (Q(H)). The results from two spatially-explicit flux retrieval methods which use contrasting approaches and, to a large degree, different input data are compared for a central urban area of Shanghai, China: (1) the Local-scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme (LUMPS) and (2) an Aerodynamic Resistance Method (ARM). Sensible heat fluxes are determined at the full 6 m spatial resolution of the OMIS sensor, and at lower resolutions via pixel exceeds that of roads, water and vegetated areas, with values peaking at similar to 350 W m(-2), whilst the storage heat flux is greatest for road dominated pixels (peaking at around 420 W m(-2)). We investigate the use of both OMIS-derived land surface temperatures made using a Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) approach, and land surface temperatures estimated from air temperature measures. Sensible heat flux differences from the two approaches over the entire 2 x 2 km study area are less than 30 W m(-2), suggesting that methods employing either strategy maybe practical when operate using low spatial resolution (e.g. 1 km) data. Due to the differing methodologies, direct comparisons between results obtained with the LUMPS and ARM methods are most sensibly made at reduced spatial scales. At 30 m spatial resolution, both approaches produce similar results, with the smallest difference being less than 15 W m(-2) in mean Q(H) averaged over the entire study area. This is encouraging given the differing architecture and data requirements of the LUMPS and ARM methods. Furthermore, in terms of mean study Q(H,) the results obtained by averaging the original 6 m spatial resolution LUMPS-derived Q(H) values to 30 and 90 m spatial resolution are within similar to 5 W m(-2) of those derived from averaging the original surface parameter maps prior to input into LUMPS, suggesting that that use of much lower spatial resolution spaceborne imagery data, for example fro Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is likely to be a practical solution for heat flux determination in urban areas.

The approach requires two independent steps: 1. Cloud properties are determined from narrow-band satellite radiances. 2. These cloud properties are used together with data on water vapor column and surface albedo to calculate the atmospheric flux transmittance. The retrieved irradiance is biased low by about 3-4 W/m(2) throughout the year, corresponding to an underestimate in atmospheric flux transmittance of about 0.015 in summer and 0.04 in winter. From a least-squares linear regression, residual standard deviations of 56 W/m(2) (0.072,17.0%), 11 W/m(2) (0.052,10.8%), and 4 W/m(2) (0.021, 4.2%) are found for hourly, daily and monthly mean irradiance (transmittance, relative error), respectively. These findings indicate that the accuracy of the retrieval is comparable to first-class pyranometers in the summer half year (5% of daily-mean values), but significantly lower in winter. Two aspects requiring further investigation have been identified: 1. For thin clouds, the atmospheric flux transmittance is strongly underestimated. 2. The retrieval accuracy is reduced for snow-covered surfaces. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Deneke, H. M.; Feijt, A. J.; Roebeling, R.

Here we present a new calibration and validation of PROSPECT that separates plant pigment contributions to the visible spectrum using several comprehensive datasets containing hundreds of leaves collected in a wide range of ecosystem types. These data include leaf biochemical (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, water, and dry matter) and optical properties (directional-hemi spherical reflectance and transmittance measured from 400 nm to 2450 nm). We first provide distinct in vivo specific absorption coefficients for each biochemical constituent and determine an average refractive index of the leaf interior. Then we invert the model on independent datasets to check the prediction of the biochemical content of intact leaves. The main result of this study is that the new chlorophyll and carotenoid specific absorption coefficients agree well with available in vitro absorption spectra, and that the new refractive index displays interesting spectral features in the visible, in accordance with physical principles. Moreover, we improve the chlorophyll estimation (RMSE=9 mu g/cm(2)) and obtain very encouraging results with carotenoids (RMSE=3 mu g/cm(2)). Reconstruction of reflectance and transmittance in the 400-2450 nm wavelength domain using PROSPECT is also excellent, with small errors and low to negligible biases. Improvements are particularly noticeable for leaves with low pigment content. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Geo-rectified aerosol optical thickness (AOT), columnar water vapor (CWV) and spectral surface reflectance maps are generated from MERIS Level-1b data over land. The algorithm has been implemented so that AOT, CWV and reflectance products are provided on an operational manner, making no use of ancillary parameters apart from those attached to MERIS products. For this reason, it has been named Self-Contained Atmospheric Parameters Estimation from MERIS data (SCAPE-M). The fundamental basis of the algorithm and applicable error figures are presented in the first part of this paper. In particular, errors of +/- 0.03, +/- 4% and +/- 8% have been estimated for AOT, CWV and surface reflectance retrievals, respectively, by means of a sensitivity analysis based on a synthetic data set simulated under a usual MERIS scene configuration over land targets. The assumption of a fixed aerosol model, the coarse spatial resolution of the AOT product and the neglection of surface reflectance directional effects were also identified as limitations of SCAPE-M. Validation results are detailed in the second part of the paper. Comparison of SCAPE-M AOT retrievals with data from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) stations showed an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.05, and an average correlation coefficient R-2 of about 0.7-0.8. R-2 values grew up to more than 0.9 in the case of CWV after comparison with the same stations. A good correlation is also found with the MERIS Level-2 ESA CWV product. Retrieved surface reflectance maps have been successfully compared with reflectance data derived from the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) on board the PRoject for On-Board Autonomy (PROBA) in the first place. Reflectance retrievals have also been compared with reflectance data derived from MERIS images by the Bremen AErosol Retrieval (BAER) method.

Forest managers; however, need to monitor locations for changes in beetle populations over time. Specifically, counts of individual trees attacked in successive years provide an indication of beetle population growth and dynamics. Surveys are typically used to estimate the ratio of green (current) attack trees to red (previous) attack trees or G:R In this study, we estimate average stand-level G:R using a time-series of QuickBird multi-spectral and panchromatic satellite data, combined with field data for three forested stands near Merritt, British Columbia, Canada. Using a ratio of QuickBird red to green wavelengths (Red-Green Index or RGI), the change in RGI (Delta RGT) in successive image pairs is used to estimate red attack damage in 2004, 2005, and 2006, with true positive accuracies ranging from 89 to 93%. To overcome issues associated with differing viewing geometry and illumination angles that impair tracking of individual trees through time, segments are generated from the QuickBird multi-spectral data to identify small groups of trees. These segments then serve as the vehicle for monitoring changes in red attack damage over time. A local maxima filter is applied to the panchromatic data to estimate stem counts, thereby allowing an indication of the total stand population at fisk of attack. By combining the red attack damage estimates with the local maxima stem counts, predictions are made of the number of attacked trees in a given year. Backcasting the current year\'s red attack damaged trees as the previous year\'s green attack facilitates the estimation of an average stand G:R. In this study area, these retrospective G:R values closely match those generated from field surveys. The results of this study indicate that a monitoring program using a time series of high spatial resolution remotely sensed data (multi-spectral and panchromatic) over select sample locations, could be used to estimate G:R over large areas, facilitating landscape level management strategies and/or providing a mechanism for assessing the efficacy of previously implemented strategies.

Tropical deforestation is of prime interest since it threatens the terrestrial biomes hosting the highest levels of biodiversity. Local forest change dynamics, detected over very large extents, are necessary to derive regional and national figures for multilateral environmental agreements and sustainable forest management. Current deforestation estimates in Central Africa are derived either from coarse to medium resolution imagery or from wall-to-wall coverage of limited areas. Whereas the first approach cannot detect small forest changes widely spread across a landscape, operational costs limit the mapping extent in the second approach. This research developed and implemented a new cost-effective approach to derive area estimates of land cover change by combining a systematic regional sampling scheme based on high spatial resolution imagery with object-based unsupervised classification techniques. A multi-date segmentation is obtained by grouping pixels with similar land cover change trajectories which are then classified by unsupervised procedures. The interactive part of the processing chain is therefore limited to land cover class labelling of object clusters. The combination of automated image processing and interactive labelling renders this method cost-efficient. The approach was operationally applied to the entire Congo River basin to accurately estimate deforestation at regional, national and landscape levels. The survey was composed of 10 x 10 km sampling sites systematically-distributed every 0.5 degrees over the whole forest domain of Central Africa, corresponding to a sampling rate of 3.3%. For each of the 571 sites, subsets were extracted from both Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery acquired in 1990 and 2000 respectively. Approximately 60% of the 390 cloud-free samples do not show any forest cover change. For the other 165 sites, the results are depicted by a change matrix for every sample site describing four land cover change processes: deforestation, reforestation, forest degradation and forest recovery. This unique exercise estimates the deforestation rate at 0.21% per year, while the forest degradation rate is close to 0.15% per year. However, these figures are less reliable for the coastal region where there is a lack of cloud-free imagery. The results also show that the Landscapes designated after 2000 as high priority conservation zones by the Congo Basin Forest Partnership had undergone significantly less deforestation and forest degradation between 1990 and 2000 than the rest of the Central African forest.

Water and Energy Balance (WEB) SVAT modeling is based on forcing a prognostic root-zone water balance model with observed rainfall and predicted evapotranspiration. In contrast, thermal Remote Sensing (RS) observations of surface radiometric temperature (T-R) are integrated into purely diagnostic RS-SVAT models to predict the onset of vegetation water stress. While RS-SVAT models do not explicitly monitor soil moisture, they can be used in the calculation of thermal-based proxy variables for the availability of soil water in the root zone. Using four growing seasons (2001 to 2004) of profile soil moisture, micro-meteorology, and surface radiometric temperature measurements at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Optimizing Production Inputs for Economic and Environmental Enhancements (OPE3) study site in Beltsville, MD, prospects for improving WEB-SVAT root-zone soil water predictions via the assimilation of diagnostic RS-SVAT soil moisture proxy information are examined. Results illustrate the potential advantages of such an assimilation approach relative to the competing approach of directly assimilating T-R measurements. Since T-R measurements used in the analysis are tower-based (and not obtained from a remote platform), a sensitivity analysis demonstrates the potential impact of remote sensing limitations on the value of the RS-SVAT proxy. Overall, results support a potential role for RS-SVAT modeling strategies in improving WEB-SVAT model characterization of root-zone soil moisture.

A common method to calculate Fg is to create a simple linear mixing model between two NDVI endmembers: bare soil NDVI (NDVIo) and full vegetation NDVI (NDVI infinity). Usually it is assumed that NDVI, is close to zero (NDVIo similar to 0.05) and is generally chosen from the lowest observed NDVI values. However, the mean soil NDVI computed from 2906 samples is much larger (NDVI=0.2) and is highly variable (standard deviation = 0.1). We show that the underestimation of NDVI,, yields overestimations of Fg. The largest errors occur in grassland and shrubland areas. Using parameters for NDVI, and NDVI infinity derived from global scenes yields overestimations of Fg that are larger than 0.2 for the majority of U.S. land cover types when pixel NDVI values are 0.2 < NDVIpixel < 0.4. When using contenninous U.S. scenes to derive NDVIo and NDVI infinity, the overestimation is less (0.10-0.17 for 0.2 < NDVIpixel < 0.4). As a result, parts of the contenninous U. S. are affected at different times of the year depending on the local seasonal NDVI cycle. We propose using global databases of NDVI along with information on historical NDVIpixel values to compute a statistically most-likely estimate of Fg. Using in situ measurements made at the Sevilleta LTER, we show that this approach yields better estimates of Fg than using global invariant NDVIo values estimated from whole scenes. At the two studied sites, the Fg estimate was adjusted by 52% at the grassland and 86% at the shrubland. More significant advances will require information on spatial distribution of soil reflectance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Montandon, L. M.; Small, E.

The goals of this research are to assess wavelet algorithms applied to MODIS time series to determine expansion of row-crops and intensification of the number of crops grown. MODIS provides data from February 2000 to present, a period of agricultural expansion and intensification in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We have selected a study area near Comodoro, Mato Grosso because of the rapid growth of row-crop agriculture and availability of ground truth data of agricultural land-use history. We used a 90% power wavelet transform to create a wavelet-smoothed time series for five years of MODIS EVI data. From this wavelet-smoothed time series we determine characteristic phenology of single and double crops.

This has led to a substantial interest in the harmonization of multisensor records. Most evaluations of the internal consistency and continuity of global multisensor NDVI products have focused on time-series harmonization in the spectral domain, often neglecting the spatial domain. We fill this void by applying variogram modeling (a) to evaluate the differences in spatial variability between 8-km AVHRR, 1-km SPOT-VGT, and 1-km, 500-m, and 250-m MODIS NDVI products over eight EOS (Earth Observing System) validation sites, and (b) to characterize the decay of spatial variability as a function of pixel size (i.e. data regularization) for spatially aggregated Landsat ETM+ NDVI products and a real multisensor dataset. First, we demonstrate that the conjunctive analysis of two variogram properties - the sill and the mean length scale metric - provides a robust assessment of the differences in spatial variability between multiscale NDVI products that are due to spatial (nominal pixel size, point spread function, and view angle) and non-spatial (sensor calibration, cloud clearing, atmospheric corrections, and length of multi-day compositing period) factors. Next, we show that as the nominal pixel size increases, the decay of spatial information content follows a logarithmic relationship with stronger fit value for the spatially aggregated NDVI products (R-2 = 0.9321) than for the native resolution AVHRR, SPOT-VGT, and MODIS NDVI products (R-2 = 0.5064). This relationship serves as a reference for evaluation of the differences in spatial variability and length scales in multiscale datasets at native or aggregated spatial resolutions. The outcomes of this study suggest that multisensor NDVI records cannot be integrated into a long-term data record without proper consideration of all factors affecting their spatial consistency. Hence, we propose an approach for selecting the spatial resolution, at which differences in spatial variability between NDVI products from multiple sensors are minimized. This approach provides practical guidance for the harmonization of long-term multisensor datasets. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, a method is presented to estimate the photon recollision probability for horizontally homogeneous leaf canopies with arbitrary leaf angle distribution as well as for discrete crown canopies. The estimation is based on analytical approximation of the first-order recollision probability. Using the analytical solution of the two-stream equations of radiative transfer and Monte Carlo modeling, the first-order photon recollision probability is shown to slightly underestimate the mean recollision probability. Also, an approximation formula for the mean recollision probability in a horizontally homogeneous canopy is presented as a function of leaf area index. The method to calculate photon recollision probability in discrete crown canopies requires only the knowledge of total and between-crown canopy transmittance and is thus independent of the geometric-optical model used.

Since the tasks of spectral selection for spectral mixture modeling and spectral selection for temporal compositing are similar, these metrics may have utility for temporal compositing. This paper explores the use of two spectral similarity metrics, endmember average root mean square error (EAR) and minimum average spectral angle (MASA), for constructing temporal composites. EAR and MASA compositing algorithms were compared against four previously used algorithms, including maximum NDVI, minimum view zenith angle, minimum blue, and median red. A total of 10 different algorithms were used to create 16-day composites of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data over a 6-year period. Algorithm performance was assessed based on short-term temporal variability in spectral reflectance and in a selection of indices, both within a southwestern California study area and within five land-cover class subsets. EAR compositing produced the lowest variability for 4 out of 7 MODIS bands, as measured by the root mean square of time series residuals. MASA or EAR compositing produced the lowest root mean square residual values for all of the tested indices. To assess how compositing algorithms might affect remote sensing correlations with biophysical variables, correlations between indices calculated from different composites and live fuel moisture were compared. Correlations between indices and live fuel moisture were higher for shape-based composites compared with the standard composites. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, most satellite phenology products are not validated, and field checking coarse scale (>= 500 m) data with confidence is a difficult endeavor. In this research, we compare phenology from Landsat (field scale, 30 m) to MODIS (500 m), and compare datasets derived from each instrument. Landsat and MODIS yield similar estimates of the start of greenness (r(2) =0.60), although we find that a high degree of spatial phenological variability within coarser-scale MODIS pixels may be the cause of the remaining uncertainty. In addition, spatial variability is smoothed in MODIS, a potential source of error when comparing in situ or climate data to satellite phenology. We show that our method for deriving phenology from satellite data generates spatially coherent interannual phenology departures in MODIS data. We test these estimates from 2000 to 2005 against long-term records from Harvard Forest (Massachusetts) and Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire) Experimental Forests. MODIS successfully predicts 86% of the variance at Harvard forest and 70% of the variance at Hubbard Brook; the more extreme topography of the later is inferred to be a significant source of error. In both analyses, the satellite estimate is significantly dampened from the ground-based observations, suggesting systematic error (slopes of 0.56 and 0.63, respectively). The satellite data effectively estimates interannual phenology at two relatively simple deciduous forest sites and is internally consistent, even with changing spatial scale. We propose that continued analyses of interannual phenology will be an effective tool for monitoring native forest responses to global-scale climate variability. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Since 2002, relatively low frequency radar measurements over the Amery Ice Shelf, east Antarctica, have been acquired using the Envisat dual frequency altimeter at S (3.2 GHz) and Ku (13.6 GHz) bands, which penetrate a few meters into the fim.   The altimeter signal is however modified in summer by the presence of snowfilled crevasses. Indeed, the specularity of the snow surfaces in summer makes the altimetric signal sensitive mostly to nadir echoes, that increases the ratio between the crevasse signal and the surrounding ice-shelf signal at nadir. Crevasses are distinguished by differences in backscattering behavior compared with the surrounding ice-shelf signal. Crevasses are characterized by a strong backscatter coefficient at Ku band and anomalies in the S band altitude estimation. These two characteristics make snowfilled crevasses detectable by the dual frequency altimeter of Envisat.   We first retrieve the geometric properties of the crevasses using a hyperbolic shape function, created by strong crevasse backscatter in the Ku waveform measurements. From this retrieved crevasse signal and further waveform analysis, we assess the properties of the snow surface and its sub-surface. The crevasse, due to its small size compared to the altimeter footprint, is found to be an excellent target to study snow properties of the ice-shelf.   The anomalies in the S band altitude measurements over crevasses can then be explained by the presence of a double echo in the S band waveforms. This echo is attributed to a reflection at the base of the snowbridge, where we see evidence of sub-surface echos in the individual altimeter waveforms. Based on this observation, a methodology is developed to estimate the thickness of the snowbridge. We calculate the penetration depths in the summer snow surface of the Amery at Ku band, that is found to be around 6 in. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Pasture degradation is one of the most important problems in the Amazon, yet the manner in which grazing intensity, edaphic conditions and land-use age impact pasture biophysical properties, and our ability to monitor them using remote sensing is poorly known. We evaluate the connection between field grass biophysical measures and remote sensing, and investigate the impact of grazing intensity on pasture biophysical measures in Rondonia, in the Brazilian Amazon. Above ground biomass, canopy water content and height were measured in different pasture sites during the dry season. Using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, four spectral vegetation indices and fractions derived from spectral mixture analysis, i.e., Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV), Green Vegetation (GV), Soil, Shade, and NPV+Soil, were calculated and compared to field grass measures. For grazed pastures under dry conditions, the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (ND115 and ND117), had higher correlations with the biophysical measures than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). NPV had the highest correlations with all field measures, suggesting this fraction is a good indicator of pasture characteristics in Rondonia. Pasture height was correlated to the Shade fraction. A conceptual model was built for pasture biophysical change using three fractions, i.e., NPV, Shade and GV to characterize possible pasture degradation processes in Rondonia. Based upon field measures, grazing intensity had the most significant impact on pasture biophysical properties compared to soil order and land-use age. The impact of grazing on pastures in the dry season could be potentially measured by using remotely sensed measures such as NPV. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Cross-calibration of the MODIS 250-m data (originally designed for land use) with the well-calibrated MODIS 1-km ocean data showed that the pre-launch radiometric calibration of the 250-m bands was adequate. A simple single scattering atmospheric correction provided reliable retrievals of remote sensing reflectance at 645 nm (0.002<R-rs(645)<0.015 sr(-1), median bias=-7%, slope=0.95, intercept=0.00, r(2)=0.97, n=15). A more rigorous approach, using a multiple scattering atmospheric correction of the cross-calibrated at-sensor radiances, retrieved similar R-rs(645). R-rs(645) 087 estimates, after stringent data quality control, showed a close correlation with in situ turbidity (turbidity= 1203.9 xR(rs)(645)(1.087) 0.9 <turbidity< 8.0 NTU, r(2) =0.73, n=43). MODIS turbidity imagery derived using the developed approach showed that turbidity in Hillsborough Bay (HB) was consistently higher than that in other sub-regions except in August and September, when higher concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter seem to have caused underestimates of turbidity. In comparison, turbidity in Middle Tampa Bay (MTB) was generally lowest among the Bay throughout the year. Both Old Tampa Bay (OTB) and Low Tampa Bay (LTB) showed marked seasonal variations with higher turbidity in LTB during the dry season and in OTB during the wet season, respectively. This seasonality is linked to wind-driven bottom resuspension events in lower portion of the Bay and river inputs of sediments in the upper portion of the Bay. The Bay also experiences significant interannual variation in turbidity, which was attributed primarily to changes in wind forcing. Compared with the once-per-month, nonsynoptic in situ surveys, synoptic and frequent sampling facilitated by satellite remote sensing provides improved assessments of turbidity patterns and thus a valuable tool for operational monitoring of water quality of estuarine and coastal waters such as in Tarnpa Bay.

We used this relationship to analyze the intra- and inter-annual variations surface soil moisture in two burned black spruce forests in Alaska. The results of this study showed distinct seasonal and longer-term trends in soil moisture in the two sites, with the site that burned in 1994 having higher soil moisture than the site that burned in 1999. The differences in soil moisture between the sites were related to landscape-scale variations in soil drainage and seasonal permafrost thawing. Finally, we found that the 1999 site had dramatically lower levels of tree recruitment (both aspen and black spruce) than the 1994 site as a result of the lower soil moisture levels. These results show that the ERS SAR and similar systems can be used to monitor a site characteristic that is important to understanding changes in the ecosystem community structure that result from variations in climate and the fire regime in the boreal region.

Landsat TM imagery was combined with image texture and ancillary environmental data to model probabilities of palustrine wetland occurrence in Yellowstone National Park using classification trees. Model training and test locations were identified from National Wetlands inventory maps, and classification trees were built for seven years spanning a range of annual precipitation. At a coarse level, palustrine wetland was separated from upland. At a finer level, five palustrine wetland types were discriminated: aquatic bed (PAB), emergent (PEM), forested (PFO), scrub-shrub (PSS), and unconsolidated shore (PUS). TM-derived variables alone were relatively accurate at separating wetland from upland, but model error rates dropped incrementally as image texture, DEM-derived terrain variables, and other ancillary GIS layers were added. For classification trees making use of all available predictors, average overall test error rates were 7.8% for palustrine wetland/upland models and 17.0% for palustrine wetland type models, with consistent accuracies across years. However, models were prone to wetland over-prediction. While the predominant PEM class was classified with omission and commission error rates less than 14%, we had difficulty identifying the PAB and PSS classes. Ancillary vegetation information greatly improved PSS classification and moderately improved PFO discrimination. Association with geothermal areas distinguished PUS wetlands. Wetland over-prediction was exacerbated by class imbalance in likely combination with spatial and spectral limitations of the TM sensor.

Using field, Ikonos and Landsat data at three sites in northern Canada, we evaluate a physical unmixing method against two modeling approaches to map five land cover fractions that include bare, grass, deciduous shrub, conifer, and water along an 1100 km north-south transect crossing the tree-line of northern Canada. Error analyses are presented to assess factors that affect fractional mapping results, including modeling method (linear least squares inversion (LLSI) vs. linear regression vs. regression trees), number of Landsat spectral bands (3 vs. 5), local and distant fraction estimation using locally and globally calibrated models, and spatial resolution (30 m vs. 90 m). The ultimate purpose of this study is to determine if reliable land cover fractions can be obtained for biophysical modeling over northern Canada from a three band, resampled 90 m Landsat ETM+ mosaic north of the tree-line. Of the three modeling methods tested, linear regression and regression trees with five spectral bands produced the best local fraction estimates, while LLSI produced comparable results when unmixing was sufficiently determined. However, distant fraction estimation using both locally and globally calibrated models was most accurate using the three spectral bands available in the Landsat mosaic of northern Canada at 30 m resolution, and only slightly worse at 90 m resolution. While local calibrations produced more accurate fractions than global calibrations, application of local calibration models requires stratification of areas where local endmembers and models are representative. In the absence of such information, globally calibrated linear regression and regression trees to estimate separate fractions is an acceptable alternative, producing similar root mean square error, and an average absolute bias of less than 2%.

The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) measures the anisotropic reflectance of the land surface thus has the potential to improve the operational mapping of canopy attributes in Queensland, one of the largest states in Australia. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between foliage projective cover (FPC) and the shape of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for a mixed grassland/woodland ecosystem, the Southern Brigalow Belt Biogeographic Region. A practical approach for deriving the surface bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) from MISR \"Local\" mode data using existing MISR products is presented. The BRDF typology of the land surface was determined using shape parameters derived from inversion of the linear Ross-Thick Li-Sparse Reciprocal and the non-linear Rahman-Pinty-Verstracte (RPV) models against a time series of MISR \"Local\" mode surface BRF data. Following an evaluation of the models inversion error, the RPV model was examined for correlation with FPC, a canopy attribute routinely derived from Landsat data in Queensland. Our empirical analyses showed the MISR derived RPV model parameters were qualitatively related to spatial and temporal variations in vegetation structure in Queensland and the k parameter contained information independent of FPC. These results are consistent with published findings from other regions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Queensland Dept Nat Resources & Water, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia.

The material was very fine and comprised of large amounts and different types of salts, high electrical conductivity, a propensity for slaking and the presence of cyanobacteria. The surfaces of 4 plots at each site were modified using in situ rainfall simulation and wind tunnel abrasion. The changes in the surface conditions were recorded using digital images and multi-angular spectral measurements of reflectance and inverted against a soil bi-directional spectral reflectance model. Optimised values of the model parameters produced the single scattering albedo (SSA) and a description of the scattering behaviour of the soil surfaces that included an estimate of microscopic roughness. The model parameters removed the effect of the measurement conditions (illumination and viewing geometry) on the spectral reflectance.   Abrasion of the untreated surfaces demonstrated that the variability in the antecedent surface conditions played an important role in their response. Rainfall, drying and subsequent abrasion appeared to reset the soil surface conditions and controlled the spatial and temporal variation in the soil surface conditions. Redundancy analyses, conducted separately for SSA of selected wavebands, model parameter values and treatments elucidated the subtle and interactive effects of the treatments and surface responses. The results showed that high intensity rainfall and abrasion was associated with wavebands in the visible region and reduced roughness. Low intensity rainfall was associated with wavebands in the near-infrared and short-wave infrared regions and increased roughness. The analysis was interpreted as the result of eluviation due to rainsplash impact which caused size segregation and the preferential translocation of iron oxides to the surface and the creation of a thick surface seal and caused a thin crust which enabled the movement of salts and/or mineral clays to the surface because of the strong evaporation gradient. A poor relationship between aerodynamic resistance and microscopic roughness suggested that features of soil surface erodibility created by natural environmental processes such as rainsplash and wind erosion required a correction for macroscopic roughness. The values of the model parameters appeared to be insensitive to the directional nature of the abrasion process. The findings are significant for the development of this work towards an airborne or satellite-based assessment of soil surface erodibility and erosion. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This technique, relative spectral mixture analysis (RSMA), provides information about the amount of green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV) plus litter, and snow relative to a reference time. The RSMA indices of specific ground components are defined so that they are positive when the fractional cover of a ground component is greater than that at the reference time and negative when the fractional cover is less than that at the reference time. The rationale for the new technique and its mathematical underpinnings are discussed. Example RSMA timeseries from the southern-central United States are presented based on four years of MODIS MOD43 nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (NBAR) data. This timeseries shows that the RSMA GV index, X-GV, is robust in the presence of snow. Spectral simulations show that X-GV is also robust with different soil backgrounds. The RSMA index of NPV/Iitter cover, X-NPV/(litter), provides information about the dynamics of the nonphotosynthetic portion of organic matter at or above the surface. The RSMA index of total vegetation plus litter, X-TV, provides information about the dynamics of the non-soil/non-snow portion of ground cover. Because it Mirrors the bare ground cover, X-TV may be particularly useful in remote sensing applications aimed at the study of soil erosion.

This paper analyzes the anisotropy-related error in measurements of longwave radiation flux from a building canopy. The flux difference between epsilon sigma T-r(4) and directly measured flux was up to 8% of the directly measured flux, which could be greater than the typical error in measurement of turbulent heat flux over a building canopy. The flux difference increased as the temperature variation within the urban street canyon increased, and also with increasing difference between the incident solar radiation of the building walls and street canyon floors (pavement, roads, ground surface). Theoretical calculations indicate that the flux difference is due to the structure of the building canopy and the temperature difference between the walls and canopy floors. A numerical model of a building canopy heat budget shows that the flux difference increases as the street canyon aspect ratio increases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) produces images of sufficient spatial resolution (from 15 m to 90 m) to be of use in agricultural studies, in which fields of crops are too small to be well-resolved by low resolution sensors. The ASTER project generates land surface emissivity images as a Standard Product (AST05) using the Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. However, the TES algorithm is prone to scaling errors in estimating emissivities for surfaces with low spectral contrast if the atmospheric correction is inaccurate. This paper shows a comparison between the land surface. emissivity estimated with the TES algorithm and from a simple approach using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for five ASTER images (28 June 2000, 15 August 2000, 31 August 2000, 28 April 2001 and 02 August 2001) of the agricultural area of Barrax (Albacete, Spain). The results indicate that differences are < 1% for ASTER band 13 (10.7 mu m) and < 1.5% for band 14 (11.3 mu m), but > 2% for bands 10 (8.3 mu m), 11 (8.6 mu m) and 12 (9.1 mu m). The emissivities for the five ASTER bands were tested against in situ measurements carried out with the CIMEL CE 312-2 field radiometer, the NDVI method giving root mean square errors (RMSE) < 0.005 over vegetated areas and RMSE < 0.015 over bare soil, and the TES algorithm giving RMSE similar to 0.01 for vegetated areas but RMSE > 0.03 over bare soil. The errors and inconsistencies for ASTER bands 13 and 14 are within those anticipated for TES, but the greater errors for bands 10-12 suggest the presence of problems related to atmospheric compensation and model assumptions about soil spectra. The NDVI method uses visible/near-infrared data co-acquired with the thermal images to estimate vegetation cover and, hence, provides an independent constraint on emissivity. The success of this approach suggests that it may be useful for daytime images of agricultural or other heavily vegetated areas, in which the TES algorithm has occasional failures.

Ecosystem-level measurements of GPP at eddy covariance flux towers and plot-level measurements of NPP over the surrounding landscape offer opportunities for validating the MODIS NPP and GPP products, but these flux measurements must be scaled over areas on the order of 25 km(2) to make effective comparisons to the MODIS products. Here, we report results for such comparisons at 9 sites varying widely in biome type and land use. The sites included arctic tundra, boreal forest, temperate hardwood forest, temperate conifer forest, tropical rain forest, tallgrass prairie, desert grassland, and cropland. The ground-based NPP and GPP surfaces were generated by application of the Biome-BGC carbon cycle process model in a spatially-distributed mode. Model inputs of land cover and leaf area index were derived from Landsat data. The MODIS NPP and GPP products showed no overall bias. They tended to be overestimates at low productivity sites - often because of artificially high values of MODIS FPAR (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy), a critical input to the MODIS GPP algorithm. In contrast, the MODIS products tended to be underestimates in high productivity sites - often a function of relatively low values for vegetation light use efficiency in the MODIS GPP algorithm. A global network of sites where both NPP and GPP are measured and scaled over the local landscape is needed to more comprehensively validate the MODIS NPP and GPP products and to potentially calibrate the MODIS NPP/GPP algorithm parameters.

This impacts the analysis of interannual variations in phenology and the estimates of annual carbon fluxes. For these two objectives, snowmelt effect must be removed from the phenological detection. We propose a methodology for determining the date of onset of greening in the 1982-2004 period using SPOT-VEGETATION (VGT) and NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. From 1998 onwards, the date of onset of greening is taken as the date at which the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), calculated from SPOT-VGT near and short-wave infrared bands, starts increasing. This index decreases with snowmelt but increases with vegetation greening. For the 1982-2001 period, the date of onset of greening is the date at which AVHRR-NDVI equals a pixel specific threshold (PST), determined using the results of the NDWI method in the years common to the two datasets. The methods are validated using in situ measurements of the dates of leaf appearance. RMSE of 6.7 and 7.8 days, respectively, is found using NDWI-VGT and PST-NOAA methodologies, and the difference between the two methodologies in the common years is small. Very importantly, the dates are not biased. The interannual variations of the 23-year spring phenology dataset on the study area in northern Eurasia are analysed. In average over the study area, an advance of 8 days and a delay of 3.6 days are, respectively, found over the periods 1982 - 1991 and 1993 -2004. These results confirm and complete previous studies about the greening trend, remove the uncertainty due to snow, and may improve carbon budget calculations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we present work toward the quantitative estimation of the uncertainty associated with MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), an end-product that depends on several MODIS derived vegetation indices. GPP products, available at 8-day and 1-km resolutions, were evaluated in two representative tropical ecosystems: a mixed forest site in the humid tropics (the Marsyandi river basin in the Nepalese Himalayas), and an open shrubland site in a semi-arid region (the Sonora river basin in northern Mexico). The MODIS-GPP products were compared against simulations made with a process-based biochemical-hydrology model driven by flux tower meteorological observations. Whereas the temporal march of vegetation indices and GPP products is consistent between the model and the algorithm, our study indicates that that there is a positive bias in the case of the mixed forest biome in the Marsyandi basin, and a negative bias in the case of open shrublands in the Sonora basin. We examined the error contribution from the DAO meteorological data used in the standard MODIS GPP products. The bias between the GPP estimates using DAO and tower meteorology is - 2.77 gC/m(2)/day (i.e., -77% of the mean of the tower-based GPP) in the Marsyandi, and 0.33 gC/m2/day (i.e., 18% of the mean of the tower-based GPP) in Sonora. Analysis of the temporal evolution of the discrepancies between the model and the MODIS algorithm points to the need for examining the light use efficiency parameterization, especially with regard to the representation of nonlinear functional dependencies on vapor pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and seasonal evolution of the productive capacity of vegetation as influenced by water stress.

The laser data were acquired in 1999 and 2001. Height percentiles, mean and maximum height values, coefficients of variation of the heights, and canopy density at different height intervals above the ground were computed from the laser-derived canopy height distributions. Corresponding metrics derived from the 1999 and 2001 laser datasets were compared. Forty-five of 54 metrics derived from the first pulse data changed their values significantly due to forest growth. The upper height percentiles increased their values more than the field-based height growth estimates.

Mean tree height (h(L)), basal area (G), and volume (V) were regressed against the laser-derived variables to predict corresponding values of hL, G, and V based on the 1999 and 2001 laser data, respectively. Forest growth was estimated as the difference between the 2001 and 1999 estimates. Laser data were able to predict a significant growth in all the three biophysical variables over the 2-year period. However, the accuracy of the predictions was poor. In most cases the predictions were biased and the precision was low. Finally, several key issues of particular relevance to laser-based monitoring of forest growth are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

To enhance the interpretation of satellite fire data for this region, we collected ground-based data on fires in 2001 and 2002 using a simple and passive method, and statistically related these data to corresponding estimates from AVHRR and MODIS fire products using error matrices. Multiple methods of analyses from simple to complex produced qualitatively similar results. Total accuracies for both fire products were very high (> 99%) and dominated by accurate (> 99%) non-fire detection. Kappa statistics and fire-detection accuracies were substantially lower, with omission errors higher than commission errors. Results calculated using several different sets of spatial-matching parameters of analysis showed that Kappa was 1-10.6% for AVHRR, and 0-1.4% for MODIS. User\'s accuracy for fires was 0-40% for AVHRR and 3-100% for MODIS. Producer\'s accuracy for fires was 0-8% for AVHRR and 0-1% for MODIS. Statistical evaluations of potential explanatory factors showed that fire size and sampling time were dominant factors for low accuracies. Results from this study indicate that current satellite fire products are providing a limited sample of the fire activity in the region, and that ground-based analyses can substantially contribute to the interpretation of these products.

But both the inconsistent spatial resolution between the gridded meteorological data and MODIS pixels, and the cloud-contaminated MODIS FPAR/LAI (MOD15A2) retrievals can introduce considerable errors to Collection4 primary production (denoted as C4 MOD 17) results. Here, we aim to rectify these problems through reprocessing key inputs to MODIS primary vegetation productivity algorithm, resulting in improved Collection5 MOD17 (here denoted as C5 MOD17) estimates. This was accomplished by spatial interpolation of the coarse resolution meteorological data input and with temporal filling of cloud-contaminated MOD15A2 data. Furthermore, we modified the Biome Parameter Look-Up Table (BPLUT) based on recent synthesized NPP data and some observed GPP derived from some flux tower measurements to keep up with the improvements in upstream inputs. Because MOD17 is one of the down-stream MODIS land products, the performance of the algorithm can be largely influenced by the uncertainties from upstream inputs, such as land cover, FPAR/LAI, the meteorological data, and algorithm itself. MODIS GPP fits well with GPP derived from 12 flux towers over North America. Globally, the 3-year MOD17 NPP is comparable to the Ecosystem Model-Data Intercomparison (EMDI) NPP data set, and global total MODIS GPP and NPP are inversely related to the observed atmospheric CO2 growth rates, and MEI index, indicating MOD 17 are reliable products. From 2001 to 2003, mean global total GPP and NPP estimated by MODIS are 109.29 Pg C/year and 56.02 Pg C/year, respectively. Based on this research, the improved global MODIS primary production data set is now ready for monitoring ecological conditions, natural resources and environmental changes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, reliable estimates of several critical forest canopy structure metrics, including canopy bulk density, canopy height, canopy fuel weight, and canopy base height, are required to accurately map the spatial distribution of canopy fuels and model fire behavior over the landscape. The use of airborne laser scanning (LIDAR), a high-resolution active remote sensing technology, provides for accurate and efficient measurement of three-dimensional forest structure over extensive areas. In this study, regression analysis was used to develop predictive models relating a variety of LIDAR-based metrics to the canopy fuel parameters estimated from inventory data collected at plots established within stands of varying condition within Capitol State Forest, in western Washington State. Strong relationships between LIDAR-derived metrics and field-based fuel estimates were found for all parameters [sqrt(crown fuel weight): R-2=0.86; In(crown bulk density): R-2=0.84; canopy base height: R-2=0.77; canopy height: R-2=0.98].

In this study, we processed multitemporal normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and tasseled cap wetness (TCW) data sets and compared their statistical relationships and relative efficiencies in detecting forest disturbances associated with forest type and harvest intensity at five, two and one year Landsat acquisition intervals. The NDMI and TCW were highly correlated (>0.95 r(2)) for all five image dates. There was no significant difference between TCW and NDMI for detecting forest disturbance. Using either a NDMI or TCW image differencing method, when Landsat image acquisitions were 5 years apart, clear cuts could be detected with nearly equal accuracy compared to images collected 2 years apart. Partial cuts had much higher commission and omission errors compared to clear cut. Both methods had 7-8% higher commission and 12-22% higher omission error to detect hardwood disturbance when it occurred in the first year of the 2-year interval (as compared to 1-year interval). Softwood and hardwood change detection errors were slightly higher at 2-year Landsat acquisition intervals compared to 1-year interval. For images acquired I and 2 years apart, NDMI forest disturbance commission and omission errors were slightly lower than TCW. The NDMI can be calculated using any sensor that has near-infrared and shortwave bands and is at least as accurate as TCW for detecting forest type and intensity disturbance in biomes similar to the Maine forest, particularly when Landsat images are acquired less than 2 years apart. Where partial cutting is the most dominant harvesting system as is currently the case in northern Maine, we recommend images collected every year to minimize (particularly omission) errors. However, where clear cuts or nearly complete canopy removal occurs, Landsat intervals of up to 5 years may be nearly as accurate in detecting forest change as 1 or 2 year intervals.

Geophys. Res. 106 (2001) 24033] Advanced Horizontal Range Algorithm (AHRA) and distributed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC); (2) the International Arctic Buoy Program/Polar Exchange at the Sea (IABP/POLES) surface air temperatures (SATs); (3) an elaborated version of the AHRA that uses IABP/POLES to avoid anomalous results (Passive Microwave and Surface Temperature Analysis [PMSTA]); (4) another elaborated version of the AHRA that uses T-b valiance to avoid anomalous results (Mean Differences and Standard Deviation Analysis [MDSDA]); (5) Smith\'s [J. Geophys.

Melt onset and freeze onset maps were created and compared to understand how the estimates vary between different satellite instruments and methods over different Arctic sea-ice regions. Comparisons were made to evaluate relative sensitivities among the methods to slight adjustments of the Tb calibration coefficients and algorithm threshold values. Compared to the PMSTA method, the AHRA method tended to estimate significantly earlier melt dates, likely caused by the AHRA\'s susceptibility to prematurely identify melt onset conditions. In contrast, the IABP/POLES surface air temperature data tended to estimate later melt and earlier freeze in all but perennial ice. The MDSDA method was least sensitive to small adjustments of the SMMR-SSM/I inter-satellite calibration coefficients. Differences among methods varied by latitude. Freeze onset dates among methods were most disparate in southern latitudes, and tended to converge northward. Surface air temperatures (IABP/POLES) indicated freeze onset well before the MDSDA method, especially in southern peripheral seas, while PMSTA freeze estimates were generally intermediate. Surface air temperature data estimated latest melt onset dates in southern latitudes, but earliest melt onset in northern latitudes. The PMSTA estimated earliest melt onset dates in southern regions, and converged with the MDSDA northward. Because sea-ice melt and freeze are dynamical transitional processes, differences among these methods are associated with differing sensitivities to changing stages of environmental and physical development. These studies contribute to the growing body of documentation about the levels of disparity obtained when Arctic seasonal transition parameters are estimated using various types of microwave data and algorithms.

The study takes advantage of a unique dataset, wherein field measurements of LAI were acquired at the same general time and grain size as both Landsat ETM+ and AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) imagery in four different biomes. Biome types sampled included row-crop agriculture, tallgrass prairie, mixed hardwood-conifer forest, and boreal conifer forest. The effects of bandwidth, band placement, and number of bands were isolated from radiometric quality by comparing regression models derived from individual AVIRIS channels with those derived from simulated ETM+ and MODIS channels using the AVIRIS data. Models with selected subsets of individual AVIRIS channels performed better to predict LAI than those based on the broadband datasets, although the potential to overfit models using the large number of available AVIRIS bands is a concern. Models based on actual ETM+ data were generally stronger than those based on simulated ETM+ data, suggesting that, for predicting LAI, ETM+ data suffer no penalty for having lower radiometric quality. NDVI was generally not sensitive to LAI at the four sites. Band placement of broad-band sensors (e.g., simulated ETM+ and MODIS) did not affect relationships with LAI, suggesting that there is no inherent advantage to MODIS spectral properties over those of ETM+ for estimating LAI. Spectral channels in the red-edge and shortwave-infrared regions were generally more important than those in the near-infrared for predicting LAI.

Aerial photography spanning a period of six decades, IKONOS pan-sharpened (I X I m) data, and input from the US National Park Service were used to develop land cover classification maps for the 1940s, 1960s, and 1990s. A post-classification algorithm was applied to derive land cover changes, and landscape metrics were used to analyze specific habitat classes. Overall changes in natural vegetation between 1940s and 1990s at EFMO showed interchangeable shifts whereby the canopies of some areas of deciduous forests and bottomland woodlands thinned out, whereas others transited from croplands in the 1940s to full growth forest in the 1990s. Similar patterns were observed for cropland and pasture, where the total area of cropland declined while that of pasture increased, albeit with a decline in the number of patches. Land cover changes around EFMO reflect the impacts of management decisions made in response to shifts in agricultural and economic policy while, within EFMO, the areas of \"natural\" vegetation are well maintained and devoid of any significant human activity.

Nondegraded and degraded areas in the same LCU (paired areas) were compared by: (i) testing for differences in spatial mean SigmaNDVI values, (ii) calculating the relative degradation impact (RDI) as the difference between the spatial mean SigmaNDVI values of paired areas expressed as a percentage of nondegraded rnean value, (iii) investigating the relationship between RDI and rainfall and (iv) comparing the resilience and stability of paired areas in response to natural variations in rainfall. The SigmaNDVI of degraded areas was significantly lower for most of the LCUs. Relative degradation impacts (RDI) across all LCUs ranged from 1% to 20% with an average of 9%. Although SigmaNDVI was related to rainfall, RDI was not. Degraded areas were no less stable or resilient than nondegraded. However, the productivity of degraded areas, i.e., the forage production per unit rainfall, was consistently lower than nondegraded areas, even within years of above normal rainfall. The results indicate that there has not been a catastrophic reduction in ecosystem function within degraded areas. Instead, degradation impacts were reflected as reductions in productivity that varied along a continuum from slight to severe, depending on the specific LCU. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

A climatology map, tracking SST as a function of year-day, was produced at Southern New England using 53 Landsat TM and ETM+ thermal infrared data. A recursive curve-fitting algorithm was used to fit these data and eliminate cloud contamination, resulting in an average daily temperature at every 60-m pixel. The climatology was validated against long-term in situ records that were analyzed with the same techniques. The results show, as expected, that isolated and shallow water bodies undergo more extreme temperature variation ( -2 to 25 degreesC) than deeper, well-connected embayments (I to 21 degreesC) or the coastal ocean (4 to 18 degreesC). The coastal ocean is shown to lag insolation and shallow lakes by up to 44 days, with embayments showing a gradation between these extremes. Despite the Subtle temperature range variation, there is rich detail in the spatial patterns which are relevant to the applied sciences of coastal and estuarine systems. The spatial pattern of the climatology reveals anomalous patterns, such as occur where anthropogenic forcing alters climatological patterns. The heat budget of Mount Hope Bay in northeast Narragansett Bay has anthropogenic thermal input from a large power plant, and this input is reflected in the climatology. From the results, it is seen that Narragansett Bay has, on average, a mean annual temperature of 11.86 +/- 0.41 degreesC, while the Mount Hope Bay system is consistently warmer at 12.30 +/- 0.21 degreesC and shows a delayed response to autumn cooling. The long history of Landsat data acquisition can be used to create a climatology of coastal and estuarine scale dynamics at an order of magnitude finer scale resolution than AVHRR climatologies.

The main problem in computer-aided image analysis of aerial photographs is the presence of bidirectional reflectance, which causes the spectral values of the image pixels to depend on their location in the image. Because of this, and the lack of operational methods for radiometric correction, the full potential of aerial photographs has not been utilised. This paper presents a local radiometric correction method that can be used for reducing the effect of bidirectional reflectance. The method employs satellite images that are less affected by the bidirectional reflectance for the local adjustment of the registered pixel values of aerial photographs. Because of the different spatial resolution of the aerial and satellite imagery, the local correction coefficients are computed for units that are larger than a single aerial photo pixel. In this way, the general level of brightness of the correction units can be determined on the basis of the satellite imagery while retaining the finer spatial resolution of the original aerial photo. The main advantage of the suggested method is that it does not require complex mathematical models for simulating the effect of bidirectional reflectance, neither does it require a priori knowledge of the actual forest attributes in the inventory area, but relies only on the image data.

IKONOS 1-m panchromatic imagery provides a detailed measure of spatial variations in albedo while IKONOS 4-m multispectral imagery allows the relative contributions of different materials to the spectrally heterogeneous radiance field to be determined and their abundance to be mapped. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicate that the characteristic scale of urban reflectance is consistently between 10 and 20 m for the cities in this study. Spectral mixture analysis quantifies the relative contributions of the dominant spectral endmembers to the overall reflectance of the urban mosaic. Spectral mixing spaces defined by the two low-order principal components account for 96% to 99% of image variance and have a consistent triangular structure spanned by high albedo, low albedo and vegetation endmembers. Spectral mixing among these endmembers is predominantly linear although some nonlinear mixing is observed along the gray axis spanning the high and low albedo endmembers. Inversion of a constrained three-component linear mixing model produces stable, consistent estimates of endmember abundance. RMS errors based on the misfit between observed radiance vectors and modeled radiance vectors (derived from fraction estimates and image endmembers) are generally less than 3% of the mean of the observed radiance. Agreement between observed radiance and fraction estimates does not guarantee the accuracy of the a real fraction estimates, but it does indicate that the three-component linear model provides a consistent and widely applicable physical characterization of urban reflectance. Field validated fraction estimates have applications in urban vegetation monitoring and pervious surface mapping.

This article discusses the potential and limits of these indices for the assessment of the spatial and temporal variation of biomass and of the fraction of the photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by these herbaceous native forages growing in water-saturated environments. Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization was also investigated based on simple kernel-driven models. BRDF normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) performed the best for both totorales and bofedales vegetation associations, followed by the uncorrected maximum-value composite NDVI. BRDF normalized NDVI was shown to be sensitive to the green leaf or photosynthetically active biomass.   Estimation of biomass production after Kumar and Monteith (1982) was used to determine the efficiency of solar energy conversion into biomass (epsilon(b)) for the main phenological periods, corresponding to the rainy and dry seasons. Two approaches were investigated for the biomass production estimation: the first one is based on monthly field biomass measurements; the second one is based on estimates from the regression computed previously using Roujean\'s BRDF normalized NDVI. The values found for these efficiencies for the rainy season agree with those of the literature for grasslands of temperate regions. For the dry season, more accurate information on totora and bofedal senescence and on animal consumption is required to get a reasonable efficiency value. This is not surprising, as other workers have reported biomass estimation with remotely sensed data to be most relevant to the growing season. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The SW algorithm used with TIMS channels at 8.4 and 8.7 mum (SW-12) underestimated ground temperatures by 2-5 degreesC. The TES method required atmospheric correction of at-sensor radiances, which was done with local radiosonde data and MODTRAN 4, and an empirical relationship between the spectral range of emissivity and its minimum value. Emissivity data required for the SW algorithms were obtained using vegetation cover estimates from near-coincident reflective remote sensing data. The temperature underestimation of the SW-12 algorithm could be caused by errors in the emissivity inputs calculated from the vegetation cover. Such errors were due to the high variability of surface emissivity in the 8-9-mum waveband, which was much larger than in the 10-12-mum region. This was checked using TES derived emissivities as inputs of the SW algorithms, and comparing the resulting temperatures with the TES temperatures. In this case, both the SW-56 and SW-12 temperatures agreed with TES within +/-1degreesC for all sites and scenes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Swelling soils are a major geologic hazard, and cause extensive damage world-wide every year. The cost of postconstruction mitigation and standard engineering soil tests for creation of regional maps are immense. Smectite is the clay mineral group that has the greatest swelling potential and is responsible for most of the severe swelling soil damage observed in Colorado. Data sets were acquired from 1997 to 1999 with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap). Using a matched filtering algorithm, maps of exposed clay material were produced, despite a strong vegetation cover. Among those exposures, spectral discrimination and identification of variable clay mineralogy such as smectite, smectite/illite, and kaolinite, in decreasing order of swelling potential hazard, was possible. The comparison of the results from the two sensors showed that higher spatial resolution provided purer image endmembers in more heterogeneous sites, but did not exhibit more endmembers and did not identify new natural outcrops that a lower spatial resolution data set would miss in a homogeneous terrain. However, an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the instrument by pixel summation made possible the identification of low reflectance exposures. This work demonstrates that, using recent instruments and well-established methodologies, imaging spectrometry can be of practical. help for the detection and mapping of expansive clays.

Mapping of shrubs, dwarf shrubs, and herbaceous growth is of primary importance for understanding ecosystem function in these vulnerable environments. High spatial fragmentation in these three cover types implies that they are highly mixed at spatial resolutions greater than a few meters. A new methodology is presented which uses phenological differences between shrubs, dwarf shrubs, and herbs to map fractions of each at subpixel scales. To account for seasonal differences, Landsat images acquired at the end of winter and at the beginning and end of summer were analyzed, Differentiation between elementary vegetation and soil cover fractions was achieved using a well-known multispectral unmixing technique in an adaptive way. In this way, an image-based zonal partition facilitated spectral end-members selection according to seasonal variations and to climatic/biotic/lithologic transitions, The methodology was then applied to three Landsat images of an area representing a climatic gradient in the center of Israel. New maps of spatial changes in vegetation cover fractions along the climatic gradient were produced. An important element of the new data relates to the distribution of dwarf shrubs in general, and of Sacroproterium spinosium in particular. These dwarf shrubs are of major ecological significance in countries of the eastern part of the Mediterranean Basin due to their rapid invasion into abandoned fields and burnt areas.

An iterative regression scheme using coregistered, temporally coincident, daily composites of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder SST data is used to scale the TM digital numbers in each scene to SST, approximating an atmospheric correction. This approach provides temporally concurrent match-ups, even for Landsat scenes more than 10 years old and over 1000 data points to most regressions. Analysis of the TM scenes by year-day delivers temporal resolution sufficient for insight into overall seasonal pattern and allows identification of recurring seasonal features within the study area. The dominant seasonal patterns is a cross-shelf SST gradient of coldest water nearshore in winter which reverses sign in summer and disappears in spring and fall. Differences in summer SST are evident between four adjacent bays, attributable to differences in residual circulation, freshwater input, and flushing. Recurrent frontal zones evident in summer are identified and compare well to available but noncoincident in situ hydrographic data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Results show that satellite-derived surface albedo values are on average 10% less than those measured by the AWS stations. However, the station measurements tend to be biased high by about 4% and thus the differences in absolute albedo may be less (e.g., 6%). In regions of the ice sheet where the albedo variability is small, such as the dry snow facies, the APP albedo uncertainty exceeds the natural variability. Further work is needed to improve the absolute accuracy of the APP-derived surface albedo. Even so, the data provide temporally and spatially consistent estimates of the Greenland ice sheet albedo.

The atmospheric conditions of midlatitude summer (MLS) and midlatitude winter (MLW) are considered. The results confirm that for accurate atmospheric corrections temperature and height variations have to be extended by an emissivity variation. LST maps for larger areas are generated using atmospheric corrections derived from EMCWF reanalysis and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. The corrections are spatially and temporally interpolated using Shepards\' method and a model of the diurnal LST wave, respectively.

Using high spatial resolution NASA-Scatterometer (NSCAT) wind data, a 1 degrees x1 degrees region of strong wind is identified in the Gulf during the peak of the winter monsoon. The characteristic topography of South India and Sri Lanka and their orientation to the monsoon wind tend to channel this strong wind. Air-sea heat flux analyses, using the NSCAT wind and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast objective analyses surface data, reveal that the strong winter monsoon bursts cause large latent heat loss (180 W/m(2)) from a wind-fetch region centered on 7.5 degrees N, 77.5 degrees E during January. Weak air-sea temperature gradients result in weak sensible heat loss (<15 W/m(2)) from the ocean. The ocean response to this forcing is examined using weekly and monthly mean satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) maps; these indicate a sea surface cooling of about 1 degrees C along the axis of the wind flow. A by-product of this cooling is an emergence of a SST front along the periphery of the strong wind-stress region. Time-series analyses of the surface meteorology reveal that this forcing has a periodicity of about 15 days, with a peak during the last week of December. Wind stress curl derived from the NSCAT wind data exhibits high negative values (anticyclonic Ekman pumping) on a 2-week time scale, concomitant with strong wind bursts. The features observed in the Gulf of Mannar are similar to those reported form some other locations.

Among the programmatic goals for the MODIS sensor are to assess and track changes in land use/landcover, leaf area index (LAI), and net primary productivity (NPP). For these products to be used in global models, they must be rigorously validated with site-specific data products. This article presents a review of some of the problems facing a regional- to global-scale validation effort and presents strategies for coordinating the land-cover classification process across multiple sites. We suggest the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) as the source of remotely sensed data for validation, and that the IGBP 17-class land-cover classification system be used to provide a link between more complex site-specific systems and global-scale data products.. We further recommend that the best site-specific land-cover classifications be obtained using whatever ancillary data are found to be useful as a basis for validation. In addition, we propose ways in which ambiguities in translation of classes, from specific to general systems may be identified. Finally, we stress that even though standardization of methodology among sites may not be appropriate to the goal of obtaining the best possible land-cover prodnets, there should be standardization of error analysis and metadata reporting.

Global LAI surfaces will be an early product of the MODIS Land Science Team, and the requirements for LAI validation at selected sites have prompted interest in accurate LAI mapping at a more local scale. While spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) derived from satellite remote sensing have been used to map LAI, vegetation type, and related optical properties, and effects of Sun-surface-sensor geometry, background reflectance, and atmospheric quality can limit the strength and generality of empirical LAI-SVI relationships. In the interest of a preliminary assessment of the variability in LAI-SVI relationships across vegetation types, we compared Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery from thee temperate zone sites with on-site LAI measurements. The sites differed widely in location, vegetation physiognomy (grass, shrubs, hardwood forest, and conifer forest), and topographic complexity. Comparisons were made using three different red and near-infrared-based SVIs (NDVI, SR, SAVI). Several derivations of the SVIs were examined, including those based on raw digital numbers (DN), radiance, top of the atmosphere reflectance, and atmospherically corrected reflectance. For one of the sites, which had extreme topographic complexity, additional corrections were made for Sun-surface-sensor geometry. Across all sites, a strong general relationship was preserved, with SVIs increasing up to LAI values of 3 to 5, For all but the coniferous forest site, sensitivity of the SVIs was low at LAI values above 5. In coniferous forests, the SVIs decreased at the highest LAI values because of decreasing near-infrared reflectance associated with the complex canopy in these mature to old-growth stands. The cross-site LAI-SVI relationships based on atmospherically corrected imagery were stronger than those based on DN, radiance, or top of atmosphere reflectance. Topographic corrections at the conifer site altered th SVIs in some cases but had little effect on the LAI-SVI relationships. Significant effects of vegetation properties on SVIs, which were independent of LAI, were evident. The variability between and around the best fit LAI-SVI relationships for this dataset suggests that for local accuracy in development of LAI surfaces it will be desirable to stratify by land cover classes (e. g. physiognomic type and successional stage) and to vary the SVI.

Results show that for cloud-free scenes, the MIR data are well related to the snow and vegetation cover. Under cloudy conditions the MODIS snow mapping algorithm, which uses visible and near-infrared data, is unable to detect snow cover. However, the surface cover is still clearly discernible in the MIR images. It is suggested that high frequency microwave data may be used to supplement the MODIS, or other visible and near-infrared derived snow cover products, during cloudy conditions.

Additional spectral data (e.g., absorption, subsurface reflectance), related reflectance and K-PAR to changes in phytoplankton pigments, organic matter, and suspended sediments. Optically, Pamlico Sound, North Carolina is dominated by scattering from suspended sediments, whereas the tributary rivers are dominated by absorption from both dissolved and particulate organic matter. A general relationship developed between R-d and K-PAR (r(2)=0.72) in Pamlico Sound was found useful in a variety of environmental conditions; however a relationship between R-d and suspended sediment concentration was less robust, and affected by changing sediment characteristics. In the rivers, high and variable absorption in the visible wavelengths precluded development of a relationship between R-d and K-PAR. The relationship developed between R-d and K-PAR in Pamlico Sound is similar to those determined for Delaware Bay and Mobile Bay in previous studies, suggesting possible broader regional application of algorithms for coastal bays and estuaries having similar sediment characteristics, with direct application to SeaWiFS data.

The technique models remotely measured spectra as linear combinations of pure spectra, called endmembers, while allowing the types and number of endmembers to vary on a per pixel basis. In this manner, vegetation is characterized by a unique set of endmembers as well as by the fractions. Reference endmembers were selected from a library of field and laboratory measured spectra of leaves, canopies, nonphotosynthetic materials (e.g., stems), and soils and used to develop a series of candidate models. Each candidate model was applied to the image, then, on a per pixel basis, assessed in terms of fractions, root mean squared (RMS) error, and residuals. If a model met all criteria, it was listed as a candidate for that pixel. For this study, selection criteria included fractions between -0.01 and 1.01, an RMS less than 0.025 and a residual less than 0.025 in seven or more contiguous bands. A total of 889 two-endmember models were evaluated and used to generate 276 three-endmember models. To facilitate model selection from a large pool of candidates, an optimal set was selected to provide maximal areal coverage. A total of 24 two-endmember and 12 three-endmember models were chosen. These models were used to generate fraction images and vegetation maps showing evergreen and drought deciduous or senesced vegetation. We found that a majority of the image could be modeled as two-endmember models. Three-endmember models provided greater areal coverage, yet provided poorer vegetation discrimination due to an increase in model overlap (two or more model candidates modeling the same pixel). The vegetation maps demonstrate that the technique is capable of discriminating a large number of spectrally distinct types of vegetation while capturing the mosaic-like spatial distribution typical of chaparral. However, additional research is required to fully evaluate the technique and validate the vegetation maps that were produced.

GOME is a spectrometer measuring radiation between 240 nm and 790 mn with a spectral resolution of 0.2-0.4 nm. The ATSR-2 is an imager with four channels in the solar part and three channels in the thermal infrared part of the spectrum. Both instruments observe the Sun via a diffuser plate for relative radiometric calibration, thereby yielding reflectivities. The ATSR-2 channels at 555 and 659 nm overlap with the wavelength range of GOME. In this article, the consistency of the reflectivity calibrations of GOME and ATSR-2 is investigated at both wavelengths, by analyzing data from collocated partly cloudy scenes over the Atlantic Ocean, acquired on 23 July 1995. The main result is that reflectivities measured by both instruments agree well; the ATSR-2 reflectivity differs from the GOME reflectivity by -4.0% at 555 nm and -2.2% at 659 nm (relative differences).

The corresponding single scattering term was polarization-sensitive. The effect of the multiple scattering term on modeled canopy backscatter was less at long wavelengths than at short wavelengths. At a given wavelength, the multiple scattering term affected copolarized scattering less than cross-polarized scattering.

In this paper, we present several types of decision tree classification algorithms and evaluate them on three different remote sensing data sets. The decision tree classification algorithms tested include an univariate decision tree, a multivariate decision tree, and a hybrid decision tree capable of including several different types of classification algorithms within a single decision tree structure. Classification accuracies produced by each of these decision tree algorithms are compared with both maximum likelihood and linear discriminant function classifiers. Results from this analysis show that the decision tree algorithms consistently outperform the maximum likelihood and Zi-near discriminant function classifiers in regard to classification accuracy. In particular the hybrid tree consistently produced the highest classification accuracies for the data sets tested. More generally, the results from this work show that decision trees have several advantages far remote sensing applications by virtue of their relatively simple, explicit, and intuitive classification structure. Further, decision tree algorithms are strictly nonparametric and, therefore, make no assumptions regarding the distribution of input data, and are flexible and robust with respect to nonlinear and noisy relations among input features and class labels.

This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 mu m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 mu m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (rho(0.86 mu m) - rho(1.24 mu m))/(rho(0.86 mu m) + rho(1.24 mu m)), where rho represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-mu m and the 1.24-mu m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 mu m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 mu m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86-1.24 mu m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24;um channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 mu m, NDWI should be considered as an. independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.

During the same period, air and soil temperatures and dielectric and gravimetric moisture properties of the forest canopy and forest floor were monitored in three forest stands dominated, respectively, by black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (Picea glauca), and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera).  The calibrated ERS-1 radar backscatter values, sigma-degree, of the forest stands are shown to exhibit a pronounced temporal pattern, with little separability between tree species.  The largest change in sigma-degree, a 3-dB decrease almost independent of tree species, is observed in early winter when the soil and vegetation freeze.  In the summer, temporal fluctuations in sigma-degree are about 1-2 dB in magnitude, depending on tree species.  Diurnal variations in sigma-degree are as large as 2 dB during fall freeze-up, and less than 1 dB in summer and winter.  These temporal variations in radar backscatter from the forest are interpreted using the MIMICS radar backscatter model and the in situ surface observations as due to changes in the dielectric properties of the forest floor and forest canopy induced by precipitation (summer), drought (fall), and freezing (fall-winter) events.

Also we have identified possible caldera remnants at Black Peak, and located volcanically related collapse pits and depressions in the summit glacier of Veniaminof. Observations of Westdahl and Mt. Spurr, both of which erupted during our observation period, demonstrate that new lava flows and debris flows can be mapped by virtue of their high radar backscatter and contrast with the surrounding terrain. These data demonstrate the utility of frequent orbital radar observations in this area. Regional mapping can be carried out for volcanoes that are difficult to study in the field due to adverse working conditions (e.g., frequent cloud cover, bad weather, long periods of darkness during winter) and remote locations; timely acquisition of images soon after or during an eruption can assist in the monitoring of active volcanoes.

Digital and visual analysis showed the following results:  1) Near the capital, Dahka, within a SPOT scene (3600 km2), the extent of water varies from 324 km2 during the dry season to 1303 km2 after a destructive flood.  This means that flood-prone areas in this overpopulated deltaic region are at least four times larger than the hydrographic network observed during the dry season.  2) The Sunderbans are the world\'s largest mangroves (about 6000 km2 in a single block); two-thirds of this forest (4050 km2) are in Bangladesh, and the rest is in India.  These ecosystems seem to resist cyclones.  No sign of any kind of mangrove alteration is seen on SPOT images recorded a few weeks after disastrous cyclonic storms (20 August 1987 and 6 September 1988).   This is an important fact since the protective role of these coastal swamp forests is tremendously important.  3) The islands located in the very exposed area at the mouth of the Meghna are densely populated (more than 1000 inhabitants/km2).

According to the investigations carried out on SPOT images (25 February 1987 and 26 October 1988), the island seems to be at present satisfactorily protected against cyclones and tidal surges, behind newly planted mangroves (Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham.) and sheltered by a complex network of embankments which are visible on the images.

Although the most widely used transport models such as the moments formulations collapse the photon directional information into a limited number of directions (usually two or four), the more sophisticated methods such as discrete ordinates can, in principle, employ an unlimited number of discrete directions.  These discrete methods, however, also contain spatial discretization error and lack testing against more accurate numerical formulations for specific vegetation canopy scattering kernels.  In this article, we consider a semianalytical approach to the solution of the one-angle radiative transfer equation in slab geometry called the F(N) method.  This method has as its basis two integral equations specifying the intensities existing the vegetation canopy boundaries.  The solution is then obtained through an expansion in a set of basis functions with expansion coefficients to be determined.  These coefficients are obtained from a collocation procedure resulting in a set of algebraic equations solved by matrix inversion.  The advantage of this method is that only discretization in the angular variable is required, thus avoiding spatial truncation error entirely.  The paper begins by considering a canopy where all the leaves are oriented at the same angle.  Lambertian scattering will be assumed with unequal leaf reflectance and transmittance.  This simple model contains all the difficulties of the more complex model incorporating a general leaf angle distribution which is to be considered in the latter part of the presentation.

This analysis extends previous work by using a bidirectional canopy radiative transfer model to consider relations between instantaneous NDVI measurements and diurnally integrated canopy APAR capacity. Effective use of periodic, instantaneous remote sensing observations in landscape process studies depends on stable estimation of diurnally integrated conditions. The results from this analysis show that instantaneous NDVI measurements provide a stable and near-linear estimate of vegetation canopy diurnal APAR capacity, as long as the remotely sensed observations are taken when the solar zenith angle is above 60-degrees and the sensor views within 40-degrees from nadir. The direct/diffuse ratio of incident radiance produces little variance in the relation. Variations in canopy optical properties and architecture, as well as background spectral reflectance, also cause deviations in the APAR/NDVI relation, with background spectral reflectance properties producing the largest effect. The practical significance of this landscape variability in remotely sensed APAR assessment is uncertain. Remote sensing observation strategies are explored which might be used to evaluate and ultimately overcome the influence of landscape variance in APAR assessment. The capacity of periodic, instantaneous remotely sensed observations to characterize the diurnally integrated APAR in vegetation canopies appears resonable within the constraints noted.RP GOWARD, SN (通讯作者)，UNIV MARYLAND, DEPT GEOG, GLOBAL REMOTE SENSING STUDIES LAB, RM 1113, LEFRAK HALL, COLLEGE PK, MD 20742 USA.RI Noojipady, Praveen/B-2511-2010; Goward, Samuel/GQQ-2893-2022', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Goward, Samuel/0000-0002-3076-2546', NULL, NULL, 62, 320, 360, 1, 61, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Recent work with Nimbus-7 passive microwave measurements has also shown the complementary potential of that spectral domain.  On the other hand, the thermal infrared channels, in spite of their well-known ability to detect water stress (as established by ground studies at a local scale), are less studied for the same purpose of long-term monitoring.  This paper intends to demonstrate their capabilities in assessing crop water conditions on a regional scale and estimating the actual evapotranspiration (ET) to be used in agrometerological models.  A brief analysis of past studies justifies the use of the cumulative SIGMA-(T(s) - T(a)) (difference between the midafternoon surface temperature by satellite and the maximum air temperature obtained from the meterological ground network), named stress-degree-day by Jackson et al. (1977) which may be related to ET by a simplified linear relationship.  This criterion, already tested in Sahelian regions (Seguin et al., 1989), is applied to France on a large scale, corresponding to the entire country, using 5-day syntheses from Meteosat, calibrated by NOAA AVHRR on selected dates, for 3 years (1985-1987).  Values of SIGMA-(T(s) - T(a)) may be considered as climatological data.  They reveal both spatial differences in regional climates and the main features of each year.  The use of the linear relationship, derived from ET values computed from a coupled energy budget-water balance model, allows one to estimate and map regional evaporation on a monthly to 6-month time basis.  The variations obtained along a latitudinal transect display the relations between ET and potential evapotranspiration (PET), also leading to an indirect estimation of PET from remote sensing data.  SIGMA-(T(s) - T(a)) / R(n) is proposed as an index of regional water stress, which may be derived from satellite data and appears as complementary to the intergrated NDVI, with the advantage of a more physically established relationship with ET.RP SEGUIN, B (通讯作者)，INRA,CTR AVIGNON,BIOCLIMATOL STN,BP 91,F-84143 MONTFAVET,FRANCE.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 35, 47, 52, 0, 6, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

However, the existing scene datasets and land-use mapping products based on VHR images have the following three problems: 1) accurate geographic boundaries of urban land parcels are lacking; 2) the category systems are inconsistent with the definitions in urban land use; and 3) it is difficult to achieve efficient and fully automated mapping in multiple cities. To tackle these problems, the GlobalUrbanNetbased automatic multi-city mapping and analysis (GAMMA) framework is proposed in this article. The GAMMA framework is made up of the GlobalUrbanNet (GUN) dataset, the multi-city fully automatic urban land-use mapping (AutoULUM) method, and the analysis of urban development patterns. Specifically, the large-scale 42-category fine-grained VHR urban land-use dataset-the GUN dataset-was constructed to deal with the above global urban land-use mapping problems, which contains 1,846,151 samples and 42 land-use categories covering six continents. The GUN dataset samples with land-use semantics and parcel boundaries were generated automatically based on the open-source area of interest (AOI) data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). In addition, the AutoULUM method is proposed to automate the process of OSM road network rectification and land parcel generation. On this basis, efficient and complete multi-city land-use maps can be produced using the GUNpretrained scene classification models. To establish a benchmark for urban land-use classification, the representative urban land-use classification methods were evaluated on the GUN dataset. For further application, eight megacities from six continents were selected for automatic land-use mapping and analysis, i.e., Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chengdu in Asia, Helsinki in Europe, Nairobi in Africa, New York in North America, Rio de Janeiro in South America, and Sydney in Oceania. The results show that the models trained on the proposed GUN dataset have good generalizability in global urban areas, the AutoULUM method achieves efficient and fully automatic land-use mapping, and the GAMMA framework will help boost the coordinated development of multiple cities around the world.', '[Zhong, Yanfei; Yan, Bowen; Yi, Jingjun; Yang, Ruiyi; Xu, Mengzi; Su, Yu; Zheng, Zhendong; Zhang, Liangpei] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & Re, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

Conversely, Near-Real-Time (NRT) monitoring of crop progress from timely available remote sensing data is barely investigated because of the lack of high-frequency cloud-free satellite observations and future potential crop development. To address the challenge, this study proposes a novel algorithm for operational NRT monitoring of crop progress at the field scale. This algorithm first fuses the high spatial resolution (30 m) Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data and the high temporal frequent (10 min) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) observations to generate cloud-free time series of HLS-ABI EVI2 (two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index) with a Spatiotemporal Shape-Matching Model (SSMM). It then predicts future potential EVI2 values at a given pixel using a reference EVI2 time series obtained from the neighboring pixels in the preceding year. Integrating the currently available HLS-ABI observations and the predicted future EVI2 values to generate annual EVI2 time series, the algorithm finally detects six crop phenometrics including greenup onset, mid-greenup phase, maturity onset, senescence onset, mid-senescence phase, and dormancy onset. The NRT monitoring, which are separated as near-real-time prediction (phenological event detected after the occurrence), real-time prediction (phenological event detected around the occurrence), and short-term prediction (phenological event detected before the occurrence), are continuously updated and improved with new HLS and ABI observations at a weekly basis throughout the growing season. We evaluate the NRT monitoring against standard phenology products, PhenoCam observations, as well as the weekly Crop Progress Reports (CPRs) released from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2020 across Iowa. The evaluation demonstrates the robustness of the developed algorithm in NRT monitoring of crop phenology. Although the uncertainties are relatively large for short-term prediction compared with standard detections, the real-time prediction shows that the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) is <10 days for greenup and dormancy onset, and similar to 5 days in the other four phenometrics. Further, the real-time prediction aligns well with PhenoCam observations (R-2 = 0.96, P < 0.001) with a MAD of 7.8 days. Moreover, the HLS-ABI real-time prediction of crop phenometrics is capable of tracking NASS crop progress closely with small time shifts (<= 5 days) and significant correlations (R-2 > 0.85, P < 0.001) for various phenological stages of corn and soybean. These results prove that the algorithm could be implemented for NRT monitoring of various crop phenometrics from field, state, to national scales.', '[Shen, Yu; Zhang, Xiaoyang; Ye, Yongchang; Wang, Jianmin; Gao, Shuai; Liu, Yuxia; Tran, Khuong H.] South Dakota State Univ, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, Dept Geog & Geospatial Sci, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.

The spatiotemporal evolution of these events is char-acterised by combining passive satellite remote sensing and ground-based lidar and sun-photometer systems. The inversion algorithm GRASP is used with a suite of ground-based remote sensing instruments such as lidar/ ceilometer and sun-photometer from eight sites at different locations throughout the Iberian Peninsula. Satellite observations showed that the volcanic ash plumes remained nearby the Canary Islands covering a mean area of 120 & PLUSMN; 202 km2 during the whole period of eruptive activity and that sulphur dioxide plumes reached the Iberian Peninsula. Remote sensing observations showed that the three events were mainly composed of sulphates, which were transported from the volcano into the free troposphere.

The layer aerosol optical depth at 532 nm (AODL532) obtained from lidar measurements contributed between 49% and 82% to the AERONET total column AOD at 532 nm in event II (11-13 October). According to the GRASP retrievals, the layer aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AODL440) was higher in all sites during event II with values between 0.097 (Badajoz) and 0.233 (Guadiana-UGR) and lower in event III (19-21 October) varying between 0.003 (Granada) and 0.026 (& PRIME;Evora). Compared with the GRASP retrievals of total column AOD at 440 nm, the AODL440 had contributions between 21% and 52% during event II.

This paper contributes to the simulation of land surface emission and estimation of vegetation optical depth (VOD) at multiple frequencies using a discrete scattering model with a single set of model parameter values. Validity of the Tor Vergata (TVG) discrete scattering model in simultaneously reproducing the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band (1.4 GHz) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) C-(6.925 GHz) and X-band (10.7 GHz) ob-servations over the Tibetan grassland ecosystem is evaluated. Frequency-specific and multi-frequency calibration strategies are implemented to find the suitable set of model parameter values and to isolate the impact of fre-quency on parameter values. On this basis, the calibrated TVG model is further used to estimate the VOD, and to investigate the impact of microwave frequency and observation angle on the emission simulations and VOD parameterization.The results show that both frequency-specific and multi-frequency calibration strategies achieve comparable and reasonable simulations of SMAP and AMSR2 observations, confirming the feasibility of using an identical physically-based model (i.e. the calibrated TVG model) to simulate multi-frequency land emission driven by a single set of model parameter values. As such, the dependence of emission components and VOD on frequency can be elaborated after isolating the impact of frequency on parameter values. The VOD values derived from the TVG simulations generally increase with increasing frequency and can be linearly correlated to the LAI varia-tions, while current satellite-based retrievals have almost the same magnitude at the L-, C-, and X-band. The explanation for this can be that the retrieved VOD is different from the theoretical definition. Sensitivity test performed using the calibrated TVG model further shows that polarization-dependence of VOD becomes more apparent with the increasing observation angle and frequency. New parameterization has thus been developed to characterize the dependence of VOD on the frequency, observation angle, and polarization for grassland based on the results of sensitivity test. This study may provide new insights in improving model of land emission and retrievals of SM and VOD with physical interpretability based on multi-frequency satellite observations.', '[Bai, Xiaojing] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.

The frequent occurrence of extreme events in the 21st century complicates the understanding of terrestrial SM change and its drivers under diverse environmental conditions, particularly in the global scope. Here we globally explored the spatial-temporal trend of satellite-based SM (ESA CCI SM) and its possible drivers under a variety of environmental factors (land cover, soil texture, terrain, and vegetation coverage) during 2000-2021. Results indicate that global SM has generally declined with a rate of -0.10 x 10-3 m3m- 3 yr- 1 which is mainly dominated by the drying trend of the southern hemisphere. The moisture replenishment role of precipitation dominates in areas with relatively high SM values, and the positive influence of vegetation and precipitation on SM is prominent in regions where SM values are relatively low. But vegetation has a pronounced negative impact on SM north of 60 degrees N and in southeastern China. Compared with precipitation and vegetation, topsoil temperature has less impact on SM globally. Land cover types, soil properties, elevation, and vegetation cover influence SM variability and its response to climate and vegetation to varying degrees. For example, the overall wetting trend of SM is unique under loam soils and high elevations (> 1000 m) in terms of different soil texture and elevations. The increase in vegetation cover within a certain amount is accompanied by the wetting of SM, but in densely vegetated regions such as forests, the water retention effect of vegetation on SM is weakened. An evaluation of \'Dry gets drier, wet gets wetter\' (DDWW) paradigm from the SM viewpoint shows the paradigm summarizes 41.06% of areas with significant SM changes. Precipitation replenishment and vegetation water retention profoundly impact the \'wet gets wetter\' and \'dry gets wetter\' patterns. Temperature is a strong influencing factor of the \'wet gets drier\' pattern, while the reduction of vegetation and precipitation jointly affect the \'dry gets drier\' pattern. These findings can deepen the understanding of SM changes in relation to climate, ecology, and land surface features, particularly in the 21st century with profound changes of the environment.', '[Peng, Chenchen; Zeng, Jiangyuan; Chen, Kun-Shan; Zhang, Xiang; Shi, Pengfei; Wang, Tiantian] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Early-season maize mapping benefits maize production forecasting and other pre-harvest decision-making applications. However, most existing early-season mapping efforts rely heavily on either the current-year or historical crop labels to train classifiers, limiting the potential applications to new regions lacking crop labels. To explore the possibility of maize mapping only using satellite data in the early season, we proposed a Multi-temporal Gaussian Mixture Model (MGMM) to map maize planting areas without any crop labels. A chlorophyll content relevant proxy, named the Red-edge position (REP), was selected as model input, based on the truth that summer maize tends to show a higher chlorophyll content than other summer crops (e.g., soybean, cotton, peanut, sunflowers, etc.) in the peak season. The novel early-season mapping framework using the REP-based MGMM (MGMM-REP) was applied in four diverse areas (Iowa and Georgia in the US, Heilongjiang province (HLJ) in China, and Grand-Est in France). The MGMM-REP could generate maize maps more than two months before harvest with reasonable accuracy (F1 >= 77%) using all the available Sentinel-2 (S2) images and the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE). Our early-season maps agreed well with the existing crop maps and official statistics. The correlation coefficient (R) of the maize acreage between our early-season maps and sta-tistics was higher than 0.94. The high inter-class difference of REP between maize and other summer crops could increase the F1 score by 2-47% compared to the other commonly used Vegetation indices (VIs). Since MGMM-REP does not rely on crop labels, it had the potential to be transferred to label-scarce maize-cropped regions and contribute to the international commodity trade and food security forecast.', '[You, Nanshan; Dong, Jinwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

RTS can significantly impact permafrost stability and generate substantial carbon emissions. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of RTS is a critical step to understanding and modelling greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost thaw. Mapping RTS using conventional Earth observation approaches is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature and often small scale of RTS in the Arctic. In this study, we trained deep neural network models to map RTS across several landscapes in Siberia and Canada. Convolutional neural networks were trained with 965 RTS features, where 509 were from the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas in Siberia, and 456 from six other pan-Arctic regions including Canada and Northeastern Siberia. We further tested the impact of negative data on the model performance. We used 4-m Maxar commercial imagery as the base map, 10-m NDVI derived from Sentinel-2 and 2-m elevation data from the ArcticDEM as model inputs and applied image augmentation techniques to enhance training. The best-performing model reached a validation Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.74 and a test IoU score of 0.71. Compared to past efforts to map RTS features, this represents one of the best-performing models and generalises well for mapping RTS in different permafrost regions, representing a critical step towards pan-Arctic deployment. The predicted RTS matched very well with the ground truth labels visually. We also tested how model performance varied across different regional contexts. The result shows an overall positive impact on the model performance when data from different regions were incorporated into the training.

Improving HAB detection is crucial because massive blooms are likely to increase in both frequency and amplitude in the next decades due to global warming and escalating coastal eutrophication. While satellite remote sensing has proved useful to detect red tides and support HAB monitoring, the discrimination of the dominant bloom-forming species is still a challenge, all the more as the observation of highly concentrated phytoplankton patches can be hampered by a too coarse spatial resolution. Moreover, the majority of HAB studies generally had a regional focus, and a limited number of species were separately documented so far. Here, we provide a broader perspective for red tides remote sensing to better resolve HAB optical and taxonomical diversity. The main objective of the present study was to identify how many optical bloom types could be recognized with the high spatial resolution Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite mission. For that purpose, an extensive database of massive, nearly monospecific blooms, both documented in situ and using synchronous S2 observation was compiled. More than 100 S2 images of various red tides were selected worldwide. Altogether, the S2 database covered the typical reflectance spectra of 27 red tide forming species. The remote-sensing reflectance of each red tide was analysed to evaluate S2 ability to distinguish the dominant species of the bloom. A hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that six optical bloom types could be identified: (1) surface accumulation of cyanobacteria or of green Noctiluca scintillans, (2) surface accumulation of red N. scintillans (a purely heterotrophic plankton devoid of chlorophyll a), (3) red tides of Mesodinium rubrum (a phycoerythrin-bearing ciliate), (4) green seawater discolorations of Lepidodinium chlorophorum (a dinoflagellate with unusual carotenoids), (5) blooms dominated by a dinoflagellate such as Prorocentrum, Gymnodinium, Lingulodinium polyedra, Gonyaulax or Alexandrium, and (6) brown tides dominated by a dinoflagellate (such as Karenia, Karlodinium veneficum, Protoceratium reticulatum, Margalefidinium polykrikoides, or Tripos fusus), a prymnesiophyte (Phaeocystis), or a pelagophyte (Aureococcus anophagefferens). While the results presented here are inherently limited by the concomitant availability of in situ and S2 observations, as well as by S2 spectral resolution, it is a step forward to an improved understanding of HAB bio-optical diversity.', '[Gernez, Pierre] Nantes Univ, Inst Subst & Organismes Mer, ISOMER, UR 2160, F-44000 Nantes, France.

Conventional large satellite microwave radiometers provide the primary sounding data of moisture and temperature, with the V-band (near 50 GHz) and G-band (near 183 GHz) as the main spectra. In recent years, CubeSats are rapidly developing with compact sizes, novel designs, and low cost. The NASA TROPICS is an ongoing CubeSat constellation mission for studying tropical meteorology and storm systems, with the first Pathfinder satellite launched on 30 June 2021, which will provide a median revisit rate better than 60 min. TROPICS has innovative channels at F-band (near 118 GHz) and 205 GHz, providing a new perspective for atmospheric sounding. In this study, we have extended the NOAA MiRS system and applied it to TROPICS Pathfinder early-phase, provisionally calibrated data, focusing on moisture and temperature. We have examined the retrieval quality and compared with the ECMWF analysis and MiRS retrievals from NOAA-20 ATMS. An experiment of subsetting ATMS to match up with TROPICS channels is also conducted. Here we focus on atmospheric humidity and temperature retrievals, since they are of primary importance for microwave sounders and is tied to the core of the TROPICS mission along with precipitation retrieval. Compared to traditional channels, TROPICS F-band and 205 GHz provide new information content with distinct sensitivity to moisture and hydrometeors, showing for example over 20 K larger dynamic range of brightness temperature at 205 GHz compared to 190 GHz. The retrieved total precip-itable water compared to ECMWF has a correlation coefficient of 0.955, 0.985, and 0.977 for TROPICS, ATMS, and ATMS subset, respectively. For water vapor profile, the standard deviation of retrieval to ECMWF is 0.93, 0.76, and 0.80 g/kg for the three experiments, respectively, and regarding temperature, it is 2.5, 1.5, and 1.6 K, respectively. The retrieval shows dependence on surface type and clouds, where land and cloudy conditions degrade retrieval compared to ocean and clear condition.

High pulse density Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) holds promise to provide spatially resolved and accurate estimates of plant area density (PAD) in forested landscapes, a key step in understanding forest functioning: phenology, carbon uptake, transpiration, radiative balance etc. Inconsistencies between different ALS sensors is a barrier to generating globally harmonised PAD estimates. The basic assumption on which PAD estimation is based is that light attenuation is proportional to vegetation area density. This study shows that the recorded extinction strongly depends on target detectability which is influenced by laser characteristics (power, sensitivity, wavelength). Three different airborne laser scanners were flown over a wet tropical forest at the Paracou research station in French Guiana. Different sensors, flight heights and transmitted power levels were compared. Light attenuation was retrieved with an open source ray-tracing code (http://amapvox.org). Direct comparison revealed marked differences (upto 25% difference in profile-averaged light attenuation rate and 50% difference at particular heights) that could only be explained by differences in scanner characteristics. We show how bias which may occur under various acquisition conditions can generally be mitigated by a sensor intercalibration. Alignment of light weight lidar attenuation profiles to ALS reference attenuation profiles is not always satisfactory and we discuss what are the likely sources of discrepancies. Neglecting the dependency of apparent light attenuation on scanner properties may lead to biases in estimated vegetation density commensurate to those affecting light attenuation estimates. Applying intercalibration procedures supports estimation of plant area density independent of acquisition characteristics.', '[Vincent, Gregoire; Verley, Philippe; Delaitre, Guillaume; Maurent, Eliott; Ball, James; Clocher, Ilona; Barbier, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, AMAP, CIRAD, CNRS,INRAE,IRD, Montpellier, France.

By interpreting 60 binary decision trees, this study disentangles the error characteristics of precipitation products in terms of their spatiotemporal patterns and geographical factors. Three independent precipitation products - two satellite-based and one reanalysis datasets: the Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) late run (IMERG-L), Soil Moisture to RainAdvanced SCATterometer (SM2RAIN-ASCAT), and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 uncorrected precipitation output (MERRA2-UC), are evaluated across the contiguous United States from 2010 to 2019. The ground-based Stage IV precipitation dataset is used as the ground truth. Results indicate that the MERRA2-UC outperforms the IMERG-L and SM2RAIN-ASCAT with higher accuracy and more stable interannual patterns for the analysis period. Decision trees cross-assess three spatiotemporal factors and find that the underestimation of MERRA2-UC occurs in the east of the Rocky Mountains, and SM2RAIN-ASCAT underestimates precipitation over high latitudes, especially in winter. Additionally, the decision tree method ascribes system errors to nine different geographical characteristics, of which the distance to the coast, soil type, and DEM are the three dominant features.

Here, a new two-stage method using the deep learning model is proposed for Mapping alpine IRES from Sentinel-1 time series and Digital elevation models (MISD). Firstly, the median images of cross-orbits double-periods (i.e., the flowing period and the drying-up period of alpine IRES) Sentinel-1 time series are input to the deep learning model to synoptically extract alpine IRES in mixed pixels under the heavy cloud contamination. Secondly, the deep learning-based output is corrected by the critical drainage accumulation derived from digital elevation models to remove the disturbance of the non-channelized overland flow on upland. The MISD method was first applied to an alpine catchment, namely the Duodigou Catchment, and then was assessed in the whole Lhasa River Basin. The results showed that the application of cross-orbits double-periods Sentinel-1 time series in the deep learning model is helpful in handling the mixed-pixel problem. And the critical drainage accumulation correction further improves the deep learning-based output with F2 (the metric that measures precision and recall of model) and the median Euclidean distance error of 0.72 and 64.0 m, respectively. Subsequently, the newly proposed MISD method outperforms other river extraction methods in alpine IRES mapping with higher F2 (increased by 0.5) and lower median Euclidean distance error (decreased by 145.7 m). Moreover, the MISD method is characterized by the capability for detecting narrower or lower flow IRES with river width > 1.7 m and discharge >2 L/s, which is significantly ignored in the current global water products. Furthermore, the MISD method successfully recognizes most of the channelized IRES from permanent rivers in the whole Lhasa River Basin through essential training. Therefore, the MISD method is a powerful tool for monitoring the changes of IRES induced by the glacier retreats or the permafrost degradation, etc., on the warming Tibetan Plateau.', '[Fei, Junyuan; Liu, Jintao; Wang, Wen; Wu, Pengfei] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul Eng, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.

Motivated by estimating precipitation based on real-time data from geostationary satellites, this study proposes the Precipitation Estimation using Chromato-graphic Analysis (PECA) methodology based on full-disc observations from Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) of FengYun-4A (FY-4A). Compared with PERSIANN-CCS and FY4AQPE-Official, the results of PECA (PECA-FY4A) are comprehensively evaluated against the GSOD (global gauge data), CMS (Chinese gauge data) and IMERG-LR (micro-wave precipitation products) for the period from January, 2019 to November, 2021. The findings and conclusions mainly include but are not limited to the following: (1) PECA clearly reveals that T12, Delta T10_ 14, Delta T7_ 14, and Delta T7_ 8 are effective for estimating precipitation volumes, with strong correlation to precipitation volumes but significantly less redundant information. (2) IR band differences are still sensitive to heavy precipitation although the abilities of single IR bands have become insufficient. For example, Delta T7_8 are sensitive to heavy precipitation in the eye walls of the typhoons. (3) The evaluation results show that PERSIANN-CCS generally outperforms FY4AQPE-Official, while PECA-FY4A features significant improvements over PERSIANN-CCS (the international benchmark of IR precipitation products) in terms of CC (-10%,-100%, and -21%), RMSE (-20%,-36%, and -11%), and CSI (-25%,-100%, and -12%) against IMERG-LR, CMS and GSOD, respectively.

Clouds in optical remote sensing images seriously affect the visibility of the background and greatly reduce the usability of images for land applications. Traditional methods based on thresholding, multi-temporal or multi-spectral information are often specific to a particular satellite sensor. Convolutional Neural Networks for cloud detection often require labeled cloud masks for training that are very time-consuming and expensive to obtain. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a hybrid cloud detection method based on the synergistic combination of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and a physics-based cloud distortion model (CDM). The proposed weakly-supervised GAN-CDM method (available online https://github.com/Neooolee/GANCDM) only requires patch-level labels for training, and can produce cloud masks at pixel-level in both training and testing stages. GAN-CDM is trained on a new globally distributed Landsat 8 dataset (WHUL8-CDb, available online doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6420027) including image blocks and corresponding block-level labels. Experimental results show that the proposed GAN-CDM method trained on Landsat 8 image blocks achieves much higher cloud detection accuracy than baseline deep learning-based methods, not only in Landsat 8 images (L8 Biome dataset, 90.20% versus 72.09%) but also in Sentinel-2 images ( \"S2 Cloud Mask Catalogue \" dataset, 92.54% versus 77.00%). This suggests that the proposed method provides accurate cloud detection in Landsat images, has good transferability to Sentinel-2 images, and can quickly be adapted for different optical satellite sensors.', '[Li, Jun; Sheng, Qinghong; Wang, Bo] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Astronaut, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.

The necessary mapping of sugar-cane crop changes is especially challenging when plantation occurs under smallholders\' land ownership struc-tures used for heterogeneous crop management. We evaluated two approaches to address this challenge with the example of sugarcane abandonment in the Norte Fluminense Region, Northeastern Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The region is characterized by a large share of smallholders. We trained a random forest classifier for sugarcane for 2018 based on all available Landsat imagery. Based on the concept of temporal generalization, we applied the classifier trained in 2018 for the period from 1986 until 2020. The resulting annual sugarcane probability maps were used as input for two abandonment mapping methods: LandtrendR and muti-temporal cropland aban-donment mapping. The performance of both approaches was evaluated based on a stratified sampling approach. We detected three distinct trajectories for sugarcane farmland: i) permanently abandoned sugarcane, ii) fallow sugarcane, and iii) and stable sugarcane. The multi-temporal cropland abandonment mapping performed better for the sugarcane abandonment class (F1 = 0.84) than the LandtrendR approach (F1 = 0.21). The LandtrendR results revealed a higher omission (PA = 0.12) in mapping the sugarcane abandonment class. For the multi -temporal cropland abandonment mapping, we found that 66% (67,353 ha) of the stable sugarcane areas were abandoned between 1990 and 2016. The highest abandonment rates occurred between 1990 and 1994 and between 2010 and 2016. The spatial distribution of abandonment was heterogeneous. The earliest abandonment was concentrated in the northern part of the study area. The most recent abandonment was more extensive in the southern part of the study site. Our results highlight the advantages and challenges of using Landsat time series to map sugarcane abandonment in a heterogeneous management system. Our results also highlight the spatially and temporal heterogeneous pattern of sugarcane abandonment in the region and provide the necessary database for subsequent studies to identify underlying and proximate causes for the abandonment.', '[de Castro, Pedro Ivo Bastos] Univ Bonn, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Nussallee 17a, D-53115 Bonn, Nordrhein westf, Germany.

Over this time, Landsat data were crucial for many scientific and technical advances. Prior to the Landsat program, detailed, synoptic depictions of the Earth\'s surface were rare, and the ability to acquire and work with large datasets was limited. The early years of the Landsat program delivered a series of technological breakthroughs, pioneering new methods, and demonstrating the ability and capacity of digital satellite imagery, creating a template for other global Earth observation missions and programs. Innovations driven by the Landsat program have paved the way for subsequent science, application, and policy support activities. The economic and scientific value of the knowledge gained through the Landsat program has been long recognized, and despite periods of funding uncertainty, has resulted in the program\'s 50 years of continuity, as well as substantive and ongoing improvements to payload and mission performance. Free and open access to Landsat data, enacted in 2008, was unprecedented for medium spatial resolution Earth observation data and substantially increased usage and led to a proliferation of science and application opportunities. Here, we highlight key developments over the past 50 years of the Landsat program that have influenced and changed our scientific understanding of the Earth system. Major scientific and programmatic impacts have been realized in the areas of agricultural crop mapping and water use, climate change drivers and impacts, ecosystems and land cover monitoring, and mapping the changing human footprint. The introduction of Landsat collection processing, coupled with the free and open data policy, facilitated a transition in Landsat data usage away from single images and towards time series analyses over large areas and has fostered the widespread use of science-grade data. The launch of Landsat-9 on September 27, 2021, and the advanced planning of its successor mission, Landsat-Next, underscore the sustained institutional support for the program. Such support and commitment to continuity is recognition of both the historic impact the program, and the future potential to build upon Landsat\'s remarkable 50-year legacy.', '[Wulder, Michael A.; Hermosilla, Txomin; White, Joanne C.] Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, 506 West Burnside Rd, Columbia, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.

In this study, we proposed a bio-optical-based hyperspectral reconstruction (BBHR) algorithm to generate hyperspectral above-surface remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) data ranging in wavelength from 400 to 800 nm. One core advantage of the BBHR method is its in situ data independency, which theoretically renders the algorithm universal. The other advantage is its ability to reconstruct hyperspectral Rrs for the 400-800 nm spectral range, which facilitates the construction of more high accuracy chlorophyll-a concentration (Cchla) estimation models for optically complex waters. The reconstruction was tested by employing six widely used multispectral sensors: the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, (MERIS), Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (S3 OLCI), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (S2 MSI), Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The model performance was validated by using a ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer-measured hyperspectral dataset containing 1396 samples and a satellite-in-situ match-up dataset with 66 samples. The results show that the proposed BBHR method exhibits satisfactory performance. The average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), R2 and bias indices of the BBHR-reconstructed Rrs over all spectral bands of the six multispectral sensors were 3.27%, 8.86 x 10-4 sr-1, 0.98, and - 6.53 x 10-5 sr-1, respectively. In the field Cchla estimation experiment that contained 391 samples (mean Cchla is 25.42 +/- 16.37 mu g/L), the BBHR algorithm improved the MAPE and RMSE indices of multispectral data from 0.47 and 12.80 mu g/L to 0.42 and 10.16 mu g/L, respectively. For the satellite image match-up dataset (66 samples), the BBHR method decreased the MAPE and RMSE indices of multispectral images from 0.51 and 12.94 mu g/L to 0.32 and 8.01 mu g/L, respectively. The proposed algorithm outperformed the other two high-accuracy models in terms of spectral fidelity and Cchla estimation. In addition, the BBHR method shows great potential for the multi-source monitoring of inland water bodies. This could improve the accuracy and robustness of the reconstruction when semi-synchronized multi-source data are input and increase the consistency of multi-source data when non-synchronized multisource data are provided. Our results revealed that BBHR is a trustworthy algorithm that offers hyperspectral Rrs data and facilitates the remote monitoring of turbid inland waterbodies.', '[Guo, Yulong; Shi, Lingfei; Chen, Weiqiang; Wei, Hejie; Cai, Enxiang; Ji, Guangxing] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.

Most of the studies used monthly or yearly temporal composite NTL products as a solution for invalid observations due to cloud coverage and outlier signals. However, the impact of temporal compositing on NTL data and its applications remains largely unclear. Here, we utilized over 180,000 daily NTL tiles from NASA\'s Black Marble VIIRS product (VNP46A2, 2012-2020), covering 230 cities from China and the United States, to delve into the influence of temporal compositing on valid pixel coverage and spatiotemporal pattern of NTL data and the performance of three representative types of NTL-based applications. Our analysis showed temporal compositing was an imperative and efficient solution to the prevailing invalid observations. On average a 16-day composite was required to ensure at least 95% of valid pixel coverage for a city, where a longer composite period was needed for cities in a pluvial temperate climate zone. Compositing daily NTL data into a 3-day to 31-day period markedly reduced its spatiotemporal variation and incurred a 3-9 nWatts/cm2/sr, or 22%-37%, absolute difference in NTL magnitude, which was particularly high in developed cities and intra-city areas. We attributed such effect to the number of valid observations available for generating the composite data and the extremely high variation in daily NTL stemmed from human activities, as well as the uncertainties in VNP46 product and VIIRS instrument. The impact of temporal compositing on NTL-based applications varied greatly, from insignificant to very sensitive, across application types and spaces. Our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the capability and uncertainties in NTL data processing and applications, facilitating end-users to make the best use of NTL observations in high temporal frequency.', '[Zheng, Qiming] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Nat Based Climate Solut, 14 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore.

CBH information is critical for both aviation safety and synoptic analysis. In this study, daytime CBH is estimated directly from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-16) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) level lb data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\' (ECMWF) fifth generation reanalysis (ERAS) data using the Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) machine learning technique. The CBH estimate algorithm, which is named as GETCBH, covers the same areal extent as the full disk of the ABI/GOES-16 and only for single-layer clouds. The 2-years of CBH measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite is used as the label (which is the true value/class of the model output for regression/classification problem in machine learning terminology). A quality flag algorithm using another machine learning technique, the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees machine learning technique is developed to provide a confidence level for the CBH estimate. The evaluations show an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.87 km and Pearson\'s correlation coefficient (Pearson\'s r) of 0.92 before any quality control. After excluding CBH estimates with low confidence (19.2% of all samples), the RMSE is reduced to 1.14 km, Pearson\'s r increases to 0.97, and 96% of the estimates are within 2 km of the CALIOP results. By analyzing model bias and feature importance, cloud phase information has the biggest impact on the CBH estimate, although all input features have positive impact on the estimate accuracy. Limited by the penetrability of CALIOP, GETCBH is valid for clouds with COD < 8.5. The CBH estimates have reduced accuracy (Pearson\'s r of 0.88) for optically thin clouds (clouds with cloud optical depth [COD] < 0.1) where little cloud information is contained in the ABI measurements, as well as for optically thick clouds (clouds with COD >= 3) where a larger proportion of opaque clouds is excluded. Furthermore, for the GBTCBH model using 9 months of CloudSat measurements as label, the CBH estimates are improved with an RMSE of 1.41 km and Pearson\'s r of 0.92. In a case study of Hurricane Dorian, CBHs for most of the single-layer clouds are successfully estimated with small errors and flagged with high confidence, for both high and low clouds. Deep convective clouds and multi-layer clouds, both of which are not included in the training, are reasonably flagged as low confidence with large CBH estimate errors. In this particular case, 65% of cloudy pixels have CBH estimate with high confidence in the scene. Daytime CBH with high spatial (2 km) and temporal (10 min) resolution can be derived from ABI measurements using this methodology.', '[Lin, Han] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.

The Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI product has been widely used, but its current version (V5) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data has several limitations, such as frequent temporal fluctuation, large data gaps, high dependence on the quality of surface reflectance, and low computational efficiency. To address these issues, this paper presents a deep learning model to generate a new version of the LAI product (V6) at 250-m resolution from MODIS data from 2000 onward. Unlike most existing algorithms that estimate one LAI value at one time for each pixel, this model estimates LAI for 2 years simultaneously. Three widely used LAI products (MODIS C6, GLASS V5, and PROBA-V V1) are used to generate global representative time-series LAI training samples using K-means clustering analysis and least difference criteria. We explore four machine learning models, the general regression neural network (GRNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and identify Bi-LSTM as the best model for product generation. This new product is directly validated using 79 high-resolution LAI reference maps from three in situ observation networks. The results show that GLASS V6 LAI achieves higher accuracy, with a root mean square (RMSE) of 0.92 at 250 m and 0.86 at 500 m, while the RMSE is 0.98 for PROBA-V at 300 m, 1.08 for GLASS V5, and 0.95 for MODIS C6 both at 500 m. Spatial and temporal consistency analyses also demonstrate that the GLASS V6 LAI product is more spatiotemporally continuous and has higher quality in terms of presenting more realistic temporal LAI dynamics when the surface reflectance is absent for a long period owing to persistent cloud/aerosol contaminations. The results indicate that the new Bi-LSTM deep learning model runs significantly faster than the GLASS V5 algorithm, avoids the reconstruction of surface reflectance data, and is resistant to the noises (cloud and snow contamination) or missing values contained in surface reflectance than other methods, as the Bi-LSTM can effectively extract information across the entire time series of surface reflectance rather than a single time point. To our knowledge, this is the first global time-series LAI product at the 250-m spatial resolution that is freely available to the public (www.geodata.cn and www.glass.umd.edu).', '[Ma, Han] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430010, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Non-destructive remote sensing techniques with a large spatial coverage have become a promising method for crop biomass monitoring. However, most existing crop biomass models have only been tested at a single growth stage or only at a small number of growth stages at a single location. This has limited the ability of these AGB models to be transferred spatially, to other fields or regions, to predict AGB at any growth stage during the season, or to be potentially used with data from other sensing systems. Here, a new crop biomass algorithm (CBA-Wheat) was developed to estimate AGB over the entire growing season. It uses information on the crop growth stage, based on phenological scale observations (Zadoks scale or ZS), the day of the year or thermal indices (growing degree days), to correct AGB estimations from remotely sensed vegetation indices. The model transferability was evaluated across multiple regional test sites and different data sources (UAV and hand-held spectroscopic data). Results showed that the coefficient values [slope (k) and intercept (b)] of ordinary least squares regression (OLSR) of AGB with vegetation indices had a strong relationship with ZS. These k and b relationships were used to correct the OLSR model parameters based on the observed phenological stage (ZS value). The two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) was the best vegetation index for predicting AGB with the new CBA-WheatZS model, with R-2 and RMSE values of 0.83 and 2.07 t/ha for an experimental trial site, 0.78 and 2.05 t/ha for multiple independent regional test sites, and 0.69 and 1.87 t/ha when transferred to EVI2 derived from UAV. Model performance was lower with the day of the year and thermal index corrections; however, the use of relative growing degree-days (RGS; CBA-WheatRGS), instead of ZS information, to adjust the model parameters showed a high consistency with the CBA-WheatZS model, and a good potential for estimation of AGB at regional scales without the need for local phenological observations. The CBA-WheatRGS had validated R-2 and RMSE values of 0.82 and 2.01 t/ha for the experimental trial site, 0.76 and 2.39 t/ha for multiple independent regional test sites, and 0.66 and 2.14 t/ha for UAV hyperspectral imagery.

To explore this question, monthly changes in 21 physiochemical leaf traits and plant spectra were measured for eight deciduous tree species from the UK. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) was used to evaluate whether each trait could be predicted from a single PLSR model from reflectance spectra, or whether species- and month-level models were needed. Physiochemical traits and spectra varied greatly over the growing season, although there was less variation among mature leaves harvested between June and September. Importantly, leaf spectroscopy was able to predict seasonal variations of most leaf traits accurately, with accuracies of prediction generally higher for mature leaves. However, for several traits, the PLSR estimation models varied among species, and a single PLSR model could not be used to make accurate species-level predictions. Our findings demonstrate that leaf spectra can successfully predict multiple functional foliar traits through the growing season, establishing one of the fundamentals for monitoring and mapping plant functional diversity in temperate forests from air- and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy.', '[Chen, Litong; Zhang, Yi; Nunes, Matheus Henrique; Stoddart, Jaz; Khoury, Sacha; Chan, Aland H.

LST products from thermal infrared (TIR) satellite data have been widely used for that. However, TIR information cannot provide LST data under cloudy-sky conditions. All-sky LST can be estimated from microwave measurements, but their coarse spatial resolution, narrow swaths, and short temporal range make it impossible to generate a long-term, high-resolution, accurate global all-sky LST global. This study proposes a methodology for generating the all-sky LST product by combining multiple data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), reanalysis, and ground in situ measurements using a random forest. Field measurements from the AmeriFlux and Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD) networks were used for model training and validation. Cloudy-sky and clear-sky LST models were developed separately. To further improve the accuracy of the cloudy-sky LST model, the conventional RF model was extended to incorporate temporal information. The models were validated using in situ LST measurements from 2010, 2011, and 2017 that were not used for the model training. For the cloudy-sky and clear-sky models, root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 2.767 and 2.756 K, R2 = 0.943 and 0.963, and bias = -0.143 and - 0.138 K, respectively.

Additionally, the 10-fold cross-validation results using all the training datasets further indicate the model stability. The models were applied to generate the all-sky LST product from 2000 to 2015 over the conterminous United States (CONUS). Our product shows similar spatial patterns to the MODIS and GLDAS LST products, but it is more accurate. Both validation and product comparisons demonstrated the robustness of our proposed models in generating the allsky LST product.', '[Li, Bing; Liu, Xiaobang; Ma, Han; Chen, Yan; Liang, Tianchen; He, Tao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

MIN2OS will provide emission estimates of N2O at a horizontal resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees on the global scale and 10 x 10 km(2) on the regional scale on a weekly to monthly basis depending on the application (e.g., agriculture, national inventories, policy, scientific research). Our novel approach is based on the development of: 1) a space-borne instrument operating in the Thermal InfraRed domain providing, in clear sky conditions, N2O mixing ratio in the lowermost atmosphere (900 hPa) under favorable conditions (summer daytime) over land and under favorable and unfavorable (winter nighttime) conditions over the ocean and 2) an atmospheric inversion framework to estimate N2O surface fluxes from the atmospheric satellite observations. After studying three N2O spectral bands (B1 at 1240-1350 cm(-1), B2 at 2150-2260 cm(-1) and B3 at 2400-2600 cm(-1)), a new TIR instrument will be developed, centered at 1250-1330 cm(-1), with a resolution of 0.125 cm(-1), a Full Width at Half Maximum of 0.25 cm(-1) and a swath of 300 km. To optimally constrain the retrieval of N2O vertical profiles, the instrument will be on-board a platform at-830 km altitude in a sun-synchronous orbit crossing the Equator in descending node at 09:30 local time in synergy with two other platforms (Metop-SG and Sentinel-2 NG) expected to fly in 2031-32 aiming at detecting surface properties, agricultural information on the field scale and vertical profiles of atmospheric constituents and temperature. The lifetime of the MIN2OS project would be 4-5 years to study the interannual variability of N2O surface fluxes. The spectral noise can be decreased by at least a factor of 5 compared to the lowest noise accessible to date with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer-New Generation (IASI-NG) mission. The N2O total error is expected to be less than similar to 1% (similar to 3 ppbv) along the vertical. The preliminary design of the MIN2OS project results in a small instrument (payload of 90 kg, volume of 1200 x 600 x 300 mm(3)) with, in addition to the spectrometer, a wide field and 1-km resolution imager for cloud detection. The instruments could be hosted on a small platform, the whole satellite being largely compatible with a dual launch on VEGA-C.

However, we still lack a better understanding on both whether multi-season hyper spectral approaches are favorable over single-season approaches, as well as on the benefits of hyperspectral compared to multispectral data. Our study investigates the potential of multi-season unmixing of simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data for vegetation class fraction mapping across diverse natural and semi-natural ecoregions in California, USA. We utilized spring, summer and fall 2013 simulated EnMAP imagery derived from Airborne Visible / Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data covering study sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, Lake Tahoe and Santa Barbara. Regression-based unmixing with synthetic training datasets from spectral libraries was implemented for mapping needleleaf tree, broadleaf tree, shrub, herbaceous and non-vegetation fractions, and independent reference data was used for validation. Multi-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP had average Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) over all classes of 8.7% for the Bay Area, 8.5% for Lake Tahoe and 9.6% for Santa Barbara. However, larger errors in the low and high end of the fraction range remained, particularly in open-canopy woodlands and xeric shrub-dominated regions. Single season unmixing of simulated EnMAP revealed large seasonal and regional variations within individual vegetation classes. In most cases, the best performing single-season unmixing had similar errors as the multi-season unmixing, i.e., increment MAEs within +/- 1.0%. This points to the advantage of the multi-season integration strategy for more robust and generalized mapping independent from season and study site. Relative to EnMAP analyses, multi-season unmixing of multispectral Landsat composites for the same seasons yielded increases in average MAEs of +1.7%, +2.3% and +1.4% for the three study sites. This indicates that the higher spectral resolution of simulated EnMAP provides more relevant discriminative information when comparing contemporary image pairs. Unmixing of seasonal spectral-temporal metrics (STMs) from all available Landsat images for an entire year took advantage of the full temporal detail provided by these ongoing missions. We found Landsat STMs to effectively map vegetation class fractions, with average MAEs of 9.9%, 10.0% and 9.7% for the three study sites. Still, improvements particularly for mapping fractions of the woody vegetation classes through multi-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP point to the benefit of high spectral resolution data, and we assume that a comparable higher temporal resolution of hyperspectral satellites will further positively influence results. Overall, we conclude that multi-season unmixing of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data holds great potential for advancing vegetation class fraction mapping across natural and semi-natural ecosystems.', '[Okujeni, Akpona; Jaenicke, Clemens; Cooper, Sam; Frantz, David; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

The results demonstrate that Pakistan\'s entire population has been exposed to high PM2.5 concentrations for many years, with a mean annual value of 54.7 mu g/m(3), over all Pakistan from 2003 to 2020.This value exceeds Pakistan\'s National Environmental Quality Standards (Pak-NEQS, i.e., <15 mu g/m(3) annual mean) for ambient air defined by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) as well as the WHO Interim Target-1 (i.e., mean annual PM2.5 < 35 mu g/m(3)).The spatial analyses of the concentrations of aerosols and trace gases in terms of population density, nighttime lights, land cover types, and fire location data, and the PSCF analysis indicate that Pakistan\'s air quality is strongly affected by anthropogenic sources inside of Pakistan, with contributions from surrounding countries.Statistically significant positive (increasing) trends in PM1, PM2.   5, PM10, tropospheric NO2 VCD, and SO2 VCD were observed in similar to 89%, similar to 67%, similar to 48%, 91%, and similar to 88% of the Pakistani cities (80 cities), respectively.   This comprehensive analysis of aerosol and trace gas levels, their characteristics in spatio-temporal domains, and their trends over Pakistan, is the first of its kind. Results will be helpful to the Ministry of Climate Change (Government of Pakistan), Pak-EPA, SUPARCO (Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission), policymakers, and the local research community to mitigate air pollution and its effects on human health.', '[Bilal, Muhammad; Mhawish, Alaa; Qiu, Zhongfeng; Ali, Md Arfan; Wang, Yu] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Lab Environm Remote Sensing LERS, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.

UAV systems can generate highresolution images that provide accurate information on forest ecosystems to aid decision-making in restoration projects. However, UAV technological advances have outpaced practical application; thus, we explored combining UAV-borne lidar and hyperspectral data to evaluate the diversity and structure of restoration plantings. We developed novel analytical approaches to assess twelve 13-year-old restoration plots experimentally established with 20, 60 or 120 native tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed (1) the congruence and complementarity of lidar and hyperspectral-derived variables, (2) their ability to distinguish tree richness levels and (3) their ability to predict aboveground biomass (AGB). We analyzed three structural attributes derived from lidar data-canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), and understory LAI-and eighteen variables derived from hyperspectral data-15 vegetation indices (VIs), two components of the minimum noise fraction (related to spectral composition) and the spectral angle (related to spectral variability). We found that VIs were positively correlated with LAI for low LAI values, but stabilized for LAI greater than 2 m2/m2. LAI and structural VIs increased with increasing species richness, and hyperspectral variability was significantly related to species richness. While lidar-derived canopy height better predicted AGB than hyperspectral-derived VIs, it was the fusion of UAV-borne hyperspectral and lidar data that allowed effective co-monitoring of both forest structural attributes and tree diversity in restoration plantings. Furthermore, considering lidar and hyperspectral data together more broadly supported the expectations of biodiversity theory, showing that diversity enhanced biomass capture and canopy functional attributes in restoration. The use of UAV-borne remote sensors can play an essential role during the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, which requires detailed forest monitoring on an unprecedented scale.', '[de Almeida, Danilo Roberti Alves; Resende, Angelica Faria; de Almeida, Catherine Torres; Romanelli, Joao P.; Guillemot, Joannes; Brancalion, Pedro H.

DOC in eutrophic lakes is greatly influenced by phytoplankton phenology and terrigenous input by rivers. Therefore, it is necessary and significant to dynamically monitor the concentration, storage, and riverine exchange flux of DOC. By using in-situ DOC measurements from 2004 until 2018 (N = 2019), a machine learning algorithm, namely, a multilayer back-propagation neural network (MBPNN) model, was developed in this work to improve the remote sensing estimation of DOC concentrations in eutrophic Lake Taihu. The model yielded a mean estimation error of 15.14% for the testing dataset. The monthly mean DOC concentration significantly increased from 2003 to 2018 (N = 192, p < 0.01). High DOCs were observed in lake bays with high chlorophyll a (Chl-a) levels, and phytoplankton growth explained more than 50% of the monthly DOC variations. Then, given the evenly mixed DOC in the water column on the monthly and annual scales, we further estimated the monthly mean DOC storage in the lake from 2003 until 2018 and DOC fluxes (input and output) due to rivers during 2008-2018. Although the mean net riverine DOC input (50.56 +/- 32.22 x 10(3) t C) was approximately 5.2 times the average DOC storage (9.73 +/- 1.23 x 10(3) t C), phytoplankton growth controlled DOC variations, which indicated that much terrigenous DOC was transformed into other carbon forms after entering Lake Taihu.

A new retracking strategy has been developed to achieve the highest possible precision of coastal sea-level data. Coastal waveforms were classified into four groups according to the adaptability of dedicated coastal retrackers, from which each group was reprocessed using an optimal retracker. A modified Brown model was introduced to reprocess the quasi-specular waveforms over calm waters. A seamless transition of sea surface heights from different retrackers was achieved by estimating and removing the significant wave height dependent height differences. In order to generate the 20-Hz sea level anomaly (SLA) and total water level envelope (TWLE) at the coast, the regional along-track mean sea surface (MSS) with a high spatial resolution (-300 m) was estimated. Compared to the global MSS model, the use of the along-track MSS has dramatically reduced the SLA variance by 140 cm2 in the 0-15 km coastal strip. The results from the evaluation of data precision for Jason-2 ground tracks and the validation against tide gauges show that this new retracking strategy can retrieve more reliable sea level data nearshore. The precision of 20-Hz sea level data in the 0-5 km Australian coastal strip ranges typically from 5 cm to 6 cm in most coastal areas, which is only -1 cm lower than that beyond 5 km off the coastline. However, in Northwest Australian and some coastal regions, the data precision drops to >= 7 cm due partly to the specific coastal sea states and topography. In addition, it is found that the altimeter and tide gauge TWLE time series have a high correlation (>0.8) in the 0-5 km distance band, indicating that coastal sea-level data are useful for applications such as estimation of river plumes, long-term variation of water level in lakes and rivers, and the analysis of storm surges.', '[Peng, Fukai; Cheng, Xiao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

Here by casting the difference in the SEB between the observed reference state and a hypothetical scenario without AH, we developed a thermal stability analysis framework to identify the primary causes. Using AH estimations from six representative US cities based on Local Climate Zone (LCZ), we find that the reduced efficiency of the pathway from AH to sensible heat flux near high-rise buildings results in greater heat storage, which is a primary contributor to the underestimation. This study highlights the importance of heat storage in AH quantification using remote sensing data and provides evidence for potentially correcting the bias in AH with improved heat storage modeling.', '[Yu, Zhou; Albertson, John; Li, Qi] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.

Elements C-12 and C-32 of a covariance matrix, [C], are essential in the decomposition and cannot be ignored. Existing algorithms cannot adequately distinguish urban targets with large azimuth orientation angles from vegetation. The algorithms are complex in the formulation and procedure. To resolve the issues and envision future algorithm development, we have articulated three key modules. They are a separation factor to separate an azimuthally symmetric or asymmetric target, a diplane to model an asymmetric target in an urban area, and a procedure to derive an equivalent azimuth-orientation angle for the diplane. Then, a four-component decomposition algorithm was developed. The algorithm has been applied to multiple airborne and spaceborne PolSAR C- and L-band datasets covering areas in Canada, France, Morocco, and the USA. The primary radar target types included trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors (CRs), airport runway/taxiway, urban targets with azimuth-orientation angles ranging between 0 degrees and 45 degrees, ocean and inland water surfaces, city parks, grassland, forests, farmland, and desert. The separation factor delineates a symmetric or asymmetric target at a correct average rate of 92.7%. The diplane coupled with the derived equivalent azimuth-orientation angles correctly modeled radar backscatter from dihedral CRs and urban asymmetric targets. The algorithm delineated each type of ground target with an appropriate and dominant single, double, or volume scattering. Furthermore, the algorithm has four readily interpretable components, and its mathematical expression is not complicated. Therefore, the primary objectives to resolve the above three issues and to have an algorithm with well-balanced usability in EO studies and complexity in formulation and procedure are achieved.', '[Duan, Dingfeng; Wang, Yong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.

Although efforts have been made to map irrigated area for the U.S., multi-year nationwide maps at field-relevant resolutions are still unavailable; existing products suffer from coarse resolution, uncertain accuracy, and/or limited spatial coverage, especially in the eastern U.S. In this study, we present an approach to map the extent of irrigated croplands across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) for each year in the period of 1997-2017. To scale nationwide, we developed novel methods to generate training datasets covering both the western and eastern U.S. For the more arid western U.S., we built upon the methods of Xie et al. (2019) and further developed a greenness-based normalization technique to estimate optimal thresholds of crop greenness in any year based on those in USDA NASS census years (i.e., 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017). For the relatively humid eastern states, we collected data on the current status of center pivot irrigated and non-irrigated fields and extended these sample points through time using various indices and observational thresholds. We used the generated samples along with remote sensing features and environmental variables to train county-stratified random forest classifiers annually for pixel-level classification of irrigated extent each year and subsequently implemented a logic-based post-classification filtering. The produced Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset (LANID-US) accurately reconstructed NASS irrigation patterns at both the county and state level while also supplying new annual area estimates for intra-epoch years. Nationwide pixel-level locational assessment further demonstrated an overall accuracy above 90% across years. In the 21year study period, we found several hotspots of irrigation change including significant gains in the U.S. Midwest, the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain, and the East Coast as well as irrigation declines in the central and southern High Plains Aquifer and the southern California Central Valley, Arizona, and Florida. The resulting 30 m resolution LANID-US products represent the finest resolution account of nationwide irrigation use and dynamics across the United States to date. The developed approach, training data, and products are further extendable to other years (either before 1997 or after 2017) for continuous monitoring of irrigated area over CONUS and are spatially applicable to other regions with similar climate and cropping landscapes.', '[Xie, Yanhua; Lark, Tyler J.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm SAGE, Nelson Inst, 1710 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53726 USA.

Since ship wakes are more distinct than hulls, wakes are widely employed for ship detection from satellite imagery. In this paper, a novel approach was proposed to detect ships from optical imagery. Candidate wakes were first obtained by the normalized Radon transform of an image with the ship hull in the center. False wakes were then removed by pixel value verification, turbulent wake identification, included angle verification, and contrast verification. Meanwhile, bright edges of turbulent wakes were detected after turbulent wake identification. Detected wakes were verified with wakes delineated through visual inspection. By implementing the proposed technique to optical imagery, reflectance at the near-infrared (NIR) band of GF 1 and Sentinel 2 MSI and the panchromatic band of Landsat 8 OLI showed the best accuracies. Total recalls of turbulent and Kelvin wakes were 93.5% and 91.2%, respectively, while total precisions were 93.7% and 93.8%, respectively.

The amount of snowmelt on the surface of the ice sheet is an important metric for accurately assessing surface material loss and albedo change, which affect the stability of the ice sheet. This study proposes a framework for quickly extracting time-series freeze-thaw information at the continental scale and 40 m resolution by taking advantage of the huge amount of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired by Sentinel-1 satellites over the Antarctic, available for rapid processing on Google Earth Engine. Co-orbit normalization is used in the proposed framework to establish a unified standard of judgement by reducing the variations in the backscattering coefficient introduced by observation geometry, terrain fluctuations, and melt conditions between images acquired at different times. We implemented the framework to produce a massive dataset of both monthly freeze-thaw information over the Antarctic and higher temporal resolution freeze-thaw information for the Larsen C ice shelf from 2015 to 2019, with overall accuracies of 93% verified by a manual visual interpretation method and 84% evaluated from automatic weather station temperatures.

One of the most popular models used to estimate a biomass-related variable from SAR backscatter observations is the Water Cloud Model (WCM) because of its simplicity allowing for a straightforward retrieval. Nonetheless, a common feature of these estimates is the tendency to over- or underestimate specific ranges due to simplifying assumptions in the model. In this study, the WCM has been revisited by exploring pathways for a physically-based, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-aided, model parameterization at larger scale with the overall aim to reduce systematic retrieval errors associated with empirical assumptions in the model. The study was undertaken in Sweden where repeated observations of backscatter by the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) were available. The integration was prototyped in Sweden thanks to detailed allometries relating forest variables in the WCM. These were derived from spatially dense estimates of canopy density and vegetation height from observations by the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) and measurements of height and stem volume from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). The SAR backscatter predicted by the revisited WCM was in strong agreement with the observations. When evaluated against stem volumes estimated from the NFI data, the SAR-based stem volumes presented strong dispersion at the pixel level. Average stem volume at the level of five or more pixels, i.e., for an area larger than 0.3 ha, were instead unbiased and similar to the average values obtained from the NFI data (relative root mean square error: 21.4%, estimation bias: 0.9 m(3)/ha and coefficient of determination: 0.67). This study demonstrates that the integration of allometries in the WCM effectively reduces estimation errors.

A land general aerosol (LaGA) algorithm called the High-Precision Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (HiPARA) is proposed for the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) sensor over East Asia. In this algorithm, a monthly spectral base reflectance ratio library was constructed to obtain a pixel-by-pixel spectral reflectance relationship model. Statistical methods were used to obtain aerosol types in China, and a linearization scheme for the aerosol types was proposed based on sensitivity analysis. Based on these techniques, HiPARA achieved a completely dynamic determination of the surface reflectance and aerosol types. The new multiband aerosol characteristic retrieval strategy can return two parameters, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA). The AOD retrieved from HiPARA showed high consistency with AERONET AOD measurements, with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.939, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.082, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.113, ratios that meet an expected error (EE) of 0.825, and ratios that meet a Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) error of 0.339. Comparison of the HiPARA retrieved AOD with other operational aerosol products revealed that the accuracy of the HiPARA product was better than those of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) product (R < 0.9, RMSE > 0.175), Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) products (Dark Target (DT) algorithm, R = 0.907, RMSE = 0.203; Deep Blue (DB) algorithm, R = 0.909, RMSE = 0.139) and Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) AERDB product (R = 0.932, RMSE = 0.117). The HiPARA fitting line was close to 1:1 (i.e., y = x). The aerosol products were further evaluated for four extreme aerosol events: a smoke aerosol event, a haze aerosol event, a dust aerosol event, and a continuous aerosol variation event. Observation of the true-color images and AOD retrievals showed that the HiPARA AOD distribution matched the true-color images very well. The JAXA product had abnormal values and spatial discontinuities. The MODIS and VIIRS products were not as good as the HiPARA product in terms of spatial coverage. In the application to continuous monitoring of a dust event, the HiPARA AOD captured the variations in and intensity of the dust aerosols very well.

Laser scans represent a permanent record of the terrain topology at a given point in time. Comparison of multitemporal datasets facilitates the identification of changes occurring in the terrain over time. Vegetation points in laser scans can inhibit the alignment of sequential scans.   Therefore, vegetation points are commonly removed from the point cloud, although this can be a time-consuming process when done manually. In this study, an approach is presented and validated which makes use of multi-scale geometric operators to classify vegetation points in point clouds derived from terrestrial and aerial laser scanning. Using two study sites within the Thompson-Fraser rail corridor in British Columbia, Canada, the classification accuracies of vegetation points when compared to manual mapping was over 90%. The classified vegetation points are then segmented into individual trees. The approach is compared with outputs from the Find Individual Trees (FINT) program. The delineated trees from all approaches are incorporated into the RockyFor3D rockfall modelling program to show the implications of forest inventory construction from remote sensing methods on rockfall propagation. Over-classification of trees is shown to result in a higher predicted protective capacity of a forest when assessing a rockfall hazard.', '[Bonneau, David A.; DiFrancesco, Paul-Mark; Hutchinson, D.

They also continually modify our natural environment and landscapes. Knowledge of landslide systems is largely restricted by the stochastic nature, subjective interpretation and infrequent or spatially sparse surveying of landslides. Characterized by persistent daily movements of a couple of centimeters over multi-centennial timescales and a long narrow shape as long as similar to 4 km, the Slumgullion landslide in Colorado, USA represents an ideal natural laboratory to study slow-moving landslides. Here we demonstrate the capability of the highly accurate, spatially continuous airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system of the NASA Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) to characterize the kinematic details of internal deformation of the Slumgullion landslide using SAR interferometry (InSAR). We develop a phase-based approach to automatically extract the boundaries of the mobile geological structures without unwrapping. Comparison with historic field observations from 1991 reveals the 40-m advance of the frontal toe and shift of an internal fault. The UAVSAR data also resolve an internal minislide (100 by 70 m), which moves more southerly than the main body at 5 mm/day in the lower part of the landslide. A Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) shows that the minislide is associated with the opening of a 30 by 10 m pull-apart basin and bounding strike-slip faults. These extensional structures, nearby incised streams, and steepened local slopes helped establish the kinematic environment for the formation of the secondary minislide. The disparity between the UAVSAR InSAR-derived horizontal moving directions and the LiDAR DEM-derived slope aspects suggest that while the surface topography governs the first-order orientation, the local kinematics is also subject to the variable nature of heterogeneous landslide materials and the irregular basal bedrock surface. The landslide velocity and precipitation show similar multi-annual variations. Our study demonstrates that the freely available, high-resolution UAVSAR data, have great potential for characterizing landslide kinematics and other small-scale geological and geomorphological processes.', '[Hu, Xie; Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.

Although evidence for coseismic slip on the Hikurangi subduction interface is controversial, we present afterslip on the subduction zone beneath Marlborough using 13 months of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. The spatially and temporally correlated atmospheric errors in SAR interferograms are problematic, and hence a new InSAR time series approach, combining the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) with a spatial-temporal Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) filter to facilitate the InSAR time series analysis, is developed. For interferograms with over 250 km spatial extent, we achieve a 0.77 cm displacement RMS difference against GPS, improving 61% from the conventional InSAR time series method (TS). Comparisons between the overlapping region of two independent tracks show an RMS difference of 1.1 cm for the TS-GACOS-APS combined method, improving 54% from the TS method and 27% from using TS with an APS filter only. The APS filter reduces the short wavelength residuals substantially, but fails to remove the long wavelength error even after the ramp removal, revealing that the GACOS correction has played a key role in mitigating long wavelength atmospheric effects. The resultant InSAR displacements, together with the GPS displacements, are used to recover the time-dependent afterslip distribution on the Hikurangi subduction in-terface, which provides insights for reviewing the co-seismic slip sources, the present status of the subduction plate boundary and future seismic hazards.', '[Yu, Chen; Li, Zhenhong; Penna, Nigel T.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.

In this study, we developed an algorithm to estimate Rrs(41x) and Rrs (443) when the satellite Rrs(lambda) in blue bands suffer from large uncertainties. The algorithm first determines the Rrs(lambda) spectral shape from the satellite-measured Rrs(lambda) values at three wavelengths of 48x (486, 488, or 490), 55x (547, 551, or 555), and 67x (667, 670, or 671) nm.

We assessed the algorithm performance with satellite (SeaWiFS, MODISA, and VIIRS-SNPP) and in situ Rrs(lambda) matchups from global waters. It is shown that the uncertainties of estimated Rrs(41x) and Rrs(443) are substantially smaller than the original satellite products when applicable. Besides, implementation of the algorithm contributes to a significant increase in the number of utilizable Rrs(41x) and Rrs(443) values.

Yet, in order to mitigate hazards and prevent loss of life in these areas, and to better understand landslide processes, high-resolution measurements of landslide activity are necessary. Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) provides millimeter-scale measurements of ground surface deformation that can be used to identify and monitor landslides in remote areas where ground based monitoring techniques are not feasible. Here we present a novel InSAR deformation detection approach, which uses double difference time-series with local and regional spatial filters and pixel clustering methods to identify and monitor slow-moving landslides without making a priori assumptions of the location of landslides. We apply our analysis to freely available Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite data acquired between 2014 and 2017 centered on the Trishuli River drainage basin in Nepal. We found a minimum of 6 slow-moving landslides that all occur within the Ranimatta lithologic formation (phyllites, metasandstones, metabasics). These landslides have areas ranging from 0.39 to 1.66 km2 and long-term dry-season displacement rates ranging from 2.1 to 8.8 cm/yr. Due to periods of low coherence during the monsoon season (June - September) each year, and following the 25 April 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake, our time series analysis is limited to the 2014-2015 and 2016-2017 dry seasons (September-May). We found that each of the landslides displayed slightly higher rates during the 2014 period, likely as a result of higher cumulative rainfall that fell during the 2014 monsoon season. Although we do not have high quality InSAR data to show the landslide evolution directly following the Gorkha earthquake, the similar rates of movement before (2014-2015) and after (2016-2017) Gorkha suggest the earthquake had negligible long-term impact on these landslides. Our findings highlight the potential for region-wide mapping of slow-moving landslides using freely available remote sensing data in remote areas such as Nepal and future work will benefit from expanding our methodology to other regions around the world.', '[Bekaert, David P.

Over the last decade, proxies for chlorophyll and photosynthetic activity have been extracted from hyperspectral imagery and used to predict important photosynthetic variables such as the maximal rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron transport (J(max)). However, little research has investigated the generality of these relationships within the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limiting phases, which are characterised by mass based foliage ratios of N:P <= 10 for N limitations and N:P > 10 for P limitations.   Using measurements obtained from one year old Pinus radiata D. Don grown under a factorial range of N and P treatments this research examined relationships between photosynthetic capacity (V-cmax, J(max)) and measured N, P and chlorophyll (Chl(a+b)). Using functional traits quantified from hyperspectral imagery we then examined the strength and generality of relationships between photosynthetic variables and Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) and chlorophyll a + b derived by radiative transfer model inversion.   There were significant (P < .001) and strong relationships between photosynthetic variables and both N (R-2 = 0.82 for V-cmax; R-2 = 0.87 for J(max)) and Chl(a+b) (R-2 = 0.85 for V-cmax; R-2 = 0.86 for J(max)) within the N limiting phase that were weak (R-2 < 0.02) and insignificant within the P limiting phase. Similarly, there were significant (P < .05) positive relationships between P and photosynthetic variables (R-2 = 0.50 for V-cmax; R-2 = 0.58 for J(max)) within the P limiting phase that were insignificant and weak (R-2 < 0.33) within the N limiting phase.   Predictions of photosynthetic variables using Chl(a+b) estimated by model inversion were significant (P < .001), positive and strong (R-2 = 0.64 for V-cmax; R-2 = 0.63 for J(max)) within the N limiting phase but insignificant and weak (R-2 < 0.05) within the P limiting phase. In contrast, both SIF and PRI exhibited moderate to strong positive correlations with photosynthetic variables within both the N and P limiting phases. These results suggest that quantified SIF and PRI from hyperspectral images may have greater generality in predicting biochemical limitations to photosynthesis than proxies for N and chlorophyll a + b, particularly under high foliage N content, when P is limiting.', '[Watt, Michael S.] Scion, 10 Kyle St, Christchurch 8011, New Zealand.

In the northern hemisphere, the largest lichen biomass is in the woodlands and heathlands of the boreal zone and in tundra. Despite the global coverage of lichens, there has been only limited research on their spectral properties in the context of remote sensing of the environment. In this paper, we report spectral properties of 12 common boreal lichen species. Measurements of reflectance spectra were made in laboratory conditions with a standard spectrometer (350-2500 nm) and a novel mobile hyperspectral camera (400-1000 nm) which was used in a multiangular setting. Our results show that interspecific differences in reflectance spectra were the most pronounced in the ultraviolet and visible spectral range, and that dry samples always had higher reflectance than fresh (moist) samples in the shortwave infrared region. All study species had higher reflectance in the backward scattering direction compared to nadir or forward scattering directions. Our results also reveal, for the first time, that there is large intraspecific variation in reflectance of lichen species. This emphasizes the importance of measuring several replicates of each species when analyzing lichen spectra. In addition, we used the data in a spectral clustering analysis to study the spectral similarity between samples and species, and how these similarities could be linked to different physical traits or phylogenetic closeness of the species. Overall, our results suggest that spectra of some lichen species with large ground coverage can be used for species identification from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery. On the other hand, for lichen species growing as small assemblages, mobile hyperspectral cameras may offer a solution for in-situ species identification.

Global Vegetation Models (GVMs) predict C assimilation, but are limited by a lack spatial canopy N input. Mapping canopy N has been done in various ecosystems using remote sensing (RS) products, but has rarely considered environmental variables as additional predictors. Our research objective was to estimate spatial patterns of canopy N in European forests and to investigate the degree to which including environmental variables among the predictors would improve the models compared to using remotely sensed products alone. The environmental variables included were climate, soil properties, altitude, N deposition and land cover, while the remote sensing products were vegetation indices and NIR reflectance from MODIS and MERIS sensors, the MOD13Q1 and MTCI products, respectively. The results showed that canopy N could be estimated both within and among forest types using the random forests technique and calibration data from ICP Forests with good accuracy (r(2) = 0.62, RRMSE = 0.18). The predicted spatial pattern shows higher canopy N in mid-western Europe and relatively lower values in both southern and northern Europe. For all subgroups tested (All plots, Evergreen Needleleaf Forest (ENF) plots and Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF) plots), including environmental variables improved the predictions. Including environmental variables was especially important for the DBF plots, as the prediction model based on remotely sensed data products predicted canopy N with the lowest accuracy.', '[Loozen, Yasmina; Rebel, Karin T.; Wassen, Martin J.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands.

Existing global datasets associated with cropland are limited by insufficient spatial resolution to properly represent areas with small parcel size distributions, and their less-than-ideal accuracies hamper application at regional and local scales. Diverse very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite systems are now available, offering sub-meter to five-meter resolution (e.g. Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, and ZiYuan-3), and hence enabling explicit extraction of cropland areas from heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes. This study presented a generalized methodology for operational cropland mapping at very high resolution using a deep convolutional neural network to automatically learn the robust and discriminative features. Specifically, we slightly modified the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) and combined deep long-range features with shadow local features to provide predictions with high level of detail. We demonstrated the modified PSPNet (MPSPNet) over four province-wide study areas (Heilongjiang, Hebei, Zhejiang and Guangdong) with diverse agrosystems across China from north to south using multi-source very high spatial resolution satellite images (mainly Gaofen-1 supplemented with Gaofen-2 and ZiYuan-3), with the overall accuracies ranging from 89.99% to 92.31%. Moreover, we compared MPSPNet with other CNN models and investigated the its behavior by visualizing the learned features on different layers, indicating that combining low and high level features for final classification was an efficient and accurate strategy for cropland mapping because the former capture edge information related to object boundaries and the latter could learn long-range spatial dependencies that helped recognize croplands. The temporal transfer and spatial transfer assessments from the respects of qualitative and quantitative corroborated the robust generalizability of the proposed method. And the contrast to the traditional object-based classification method also demonstrated the advantages and strong generalization capabilities of MPSPNet in extracting cropland using VHSR remote sensed images. We compared our results with the current cropland maps generated from FROM-GLC10, which further verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach for large-scale cropland mapping at very high resolution.', '[Zhang, Dujuan; Pan, Yaozhong; Li, Nan] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Continuous satellite-based monitoring of this key plant trait would help to understand individual crop N use efficiency and thus would enable site-specific N management. Since hyperspectral imaging sensors could provide detailed measurements of spectral signatures corresponding to the optical activity of chemical constituents, they have a theoretical advantage over multi-spectral sensing for the detection of crop N. The current study aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of crop N retrieval methods from hyperspectral data in the agricultural sector and in the context of future satellite imaging spectroscopy missions. Over 400 studies were reviewed for this purpose, identifying those estimating mass-based N (N concentration, N%) and area-based N (N content, N-area) using hyperspectral remote sensing data. Retrieval methods of the 125 studies selected in this review can be grouped into: (1) parametric regression methods, (2) linear nonparametric regression methods or chemometrics, (3) nonlinear nonparametric regression methods or machine learning regression algorithms, (4) physically-based or radiative transfer models (RTM), (5) use of alternative data sources (sun-induced fluorescence, SIF) and (6) hybrid or combined techniques. Whereas in the last decades methods for estimation of Narea and N% from hyperspectral data have been mainly based on simple parametric regression algorithms, such as narrowband vegetation indices, there is an increasing trend of using machine learning, RTM and hybrid techniques. Within plants, N is invested in proteins and chlorophylls stored in the leaf cells, with the proteins being the major nitrogen-containing biochemical constituent. However, in most studies, the relationship between N and chlorophyll content was used to estimate crop N, focusing on the visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectral domains, and thus neglecting protein-related N and reallocation of nitrogen to non-photosynthetic compartments. Therefore, we recommend exploiting the estimation of nitrogen via the proxy of proteins using hyperspectral data and in particular the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral domain. We further strongly encourage a standardization of nitrogen terminology, distinguishing between N% and Narea. Moreover, the exploitation of physically-based approaches is highly recommended combined with machine learning regression algorithms, which represents an interesting perspective for future research in view of new spaceborne imaging spectroscopy sensors.', '[Berger, Katja; Wocher, Matthias; Strathmann, Markus; Danner, Martin; Mauser, Wolfram; Hank, Tobias] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.

This study proposed a new approach for modeling the NSTLR based on the Normalized Land Surface Temperature (NLST). A set of remote sensing imagery including Landsat images, MODIS products, and ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land cover maps, and climatic data recorded in meteorological stations and self-deployed devices located in the three study area were used for modeling and evaluation of NSTLR. First, the Split Window (SW) and Single Channel (SC) algorithms were used to estimate LST, and the spectral indices were used to model surface biophysical characteristics. The solar local incident angle was obtained based on topographic and time conditions for different dates. In the second step, the NSTLR value was calculated based on the LST-DEM feature space at the regional scale. The LST was normalized relative to the surface characteristics based on Random Forest (RF) regression and the NSTLR was calculated based on the NLST-DEM feature space. Finally, the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the modeled NSTLR and the observed NSTLR were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the modeled NSTLR. The mean values of R-2 between DEM and NLST were improved 0.3, 0.42 and 0.35, rather than between DEM and LST for the study area A, B and C, respectively. The R-2 and RMSE between the observed NSTLR and the Landsat derived NSTLR based on NLST for the study area A (B, C) were improved 0.30 (0.26, 0.35) and 0.81 (0.80, 0.94) degrees C Km(-1), respectively, rather than the Landsat derived NSTLR based on LST. Also, for the study area A, the R-2 and RMSE between the observed NSTLR and the MODIS derived NSTLR based on NLST in spring, summer, autumn and winter were improved 0.17, 0.12, 0.10, and 0.22; and 0.51, 0.44, 0.27, and 0.51 degrees C Km(-1), respectively, rather than the MODIS derived NSTLR based on LST.

Apparent canopy SIF yield (SIFyield apparent), determined by fluorescence yield (Phi(F)) and escaping ratio (f(esc)), together with absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), is crucial in driving spatio-temporal variability of SIF. While strong linkages between SIFyield apparent and plant physiological responses and canopy structure have been suggested, spatio-temporal variability of SIFyield apparent at regional scale remains largely unclear, which limits our understanding of the spatio-temporal variability of SIF and its relationship with photosynthesis. In this study, we utilized recent SIF data with high spatial resolution from two satellite instruments, OCO-2 and TROPOMI, together with multiple other datasets. We estimated SIFyield apparent across space, time, and different vegetation types in the U.S. Midwest during crop growing season (May to September) from 2015 to 2018. We found that SIFyield apparent of croplands was larger than non-croplands during peak season (July-August). However, SIFyield apparent between corn (C4 crop) and soybean (C3 crop) did not show a significant difference. SIFyield apparent of corn, soybean, forest, and grass/pasture show clear seasonal and spatial patterns. The spatial variability of precipitation during the growing season could explain the overall spatial pattern of SIFyield apparent. Further analysis by decomposing SIFyield apparent into Phi(F) and f(esc) using near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) suggests that fesc may be the major driver of the observed variability of SIFyield apparent.', '[Wang, Cong; Guan, Kaiyu; Peng, Bin; Jiang, Chongya; Wu, Genghong; Wang, Sheng; Miao, Guofang] Univ Illinois, Coll Agr Consumer & Environm Sci, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.

Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing, including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward, the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed.

Using rank correlations, we then analyzed the influence of four metrics of snow cover seasonality calculated from MODIS snow cover composites-first date of snow, late date of snow, duration of snow season, and the number of snow-covered dates (SCD)-on two key metrics of land surface phenology in the subsequent growing season, specifically, peak height (PH; the maximum modeled NDVI) and thermal time to peak (TTP; the amount of growing degree-days accumulated during modeled green-up phase). We evaluated the role of terrain features in shaping the relationships between snow cover metrics and land surface phenology metrics using exact multinomial tests of equivalence. Key findings include (1) a positive relationship between SCD and PH occurred in over 1664 km(2) at p < 0.01 and 5793 km(2) at p < 0.05, which account for > 8% of 68,881 km(2) of the pasturelands analyzed in Kyrgyzstan; (2) more negative than positive correlations were found between snow cover onset and PH, and more positive correlations were observed between snowmelt timing and PH, indicating that a longer snow season can positively influence PH; (3) significant negative correlations between TTP and SCD appeared in 1840 km(2) at p < 0.01 and 6208 km(2) at p < 0.05, and a comparable but smaller area showed negative correlations between TTP and last date of snow (1538 km(2) at p < 0.01 and 5188 km(2) at p < 0.05), indicating that under changing climatic conditions toward earlier spring warming, decreased duration of snow cover may lead to lower pasture productivity, thereby threatening the sustainability of montane agropastoralism; and (4) terrain had a stronger influence on the timing of last date of snow cover than on the number of snow-covered dates, with slope being more important than aspect, and the strongest effect appearing from the interaction of aspect and steeper slopes. In this study, we characterized the snow-phenology interactions in highland pastures and revealed strong dependencies of pasture phenology on timing of snowmelt and the number of snow-covered dates.', '[Tomaszewska, Monika A.; Nguyen, Lan H.] South Dakota State Univ, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.

However, the number of in-situ gauging stations is in decline worldwide. Satellite altimetry, including the recently launched satellite missions (e.g. the radar altimetry missions Cryosat 2, Jason 3, Sentinel 3A/B and the LIDAR mission ICESat-2), can determine WSE only in rivers which are more than ca. 100 m wide. WSE measurements in small streams currently remain limited to the few existing in-situ stations or to time-consuming in-situ surveys. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can acquire real-time WSE observations during periods of hydrological interest (but with flight limitations in extreme weather conditions), within short survey times and with automatic or semi-automatic flight operations. UAS-borne photogrammetry is a well-known technique that can estimate land elevation with an accuracy as high as a few cm, similarly UAS-borne LIDAR can estimate land elevation but without requiring Ground Control Points (GCPs). However, both techniques face limitations in estimating WSE: water transparency and lack of stable visual key points on the Water Surface (WS) complicate the UAS-borne photogrammetric estimates of WSE, while the LIDAR reflection from the water surface is generally not strong enough to be captured by most of the UAS-borne LIDAR systems currently available on the market. Thus, LIDAR and photogrammetry generally require extraction of the elevation of the \"water-edge\" points, i.e. points at the interface between land and water, for identifying the WSE. We demonstrate highly accurate WSE observations with a new radar altimetry solution, which comprises a 77 GHz radar chip with full waveform analysis and an accurate dual frequency differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) system. The radar altimetry solution shows the lowest standard deviation (sigma) and RMSE on WSE estimates, ca. 1.5 cm and ca. 3 cm respectively, whilst photogrammetry and LIDAR show a sigma and an RMSE at decimetre level. Radar altimetry also requires a significantly shorter survey and processing time compared to LIDAR and especially to photogrammetry.', '[Bandini, Filippo; Sunding, Tanya Pheiffer; Koppl, Christian Josef; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Bygning 115, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

Satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for vegetation phenology monitoring over large geographic domains using various types of observations and methods over the past several decades. The goal of this paper is to present a detailed review of existing methods for phonology detection and emerging new techniques based on the analysis of time-series, multispectral remote sensing imagery. This paper summarizes the objective and applications of detecting general vegetation phenology stages (e.g., green onset, time or peak greenness and growing season length) often termed \'land surface phonology\', as well as more advanced methods that estimate species-specific phonological stages (e.g., silking stage of maize). Common data processing methods, such as data smoothing, applied to prepare the time-series remote sensing observations to be applied to phenological detection methods are presented. Specific land surface phenology detection methods as well as species-specific phenology detection methods based on multispectral satellite data are then discussed. The impact of different error sources in the data on remote-sensing based phonology detection are also discussed in detail, as well as ways to reduce these uncertainties and errors. Joint analysis of multi-scale observations ranging from satellite to more recent ground-based sensors is helpful for us to understand satellite-based phenology detection mechanism and extent phenology detection to regional scale in the future. Finally, emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of phenology is presented that includes observations from Cubesats, near-surface observations such as PhenoCams and image data fusion techniques to improve the spatial resolution of time-series image data sets needed for phenological characterization.', '[Zeng, Linglin] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.

Here, we propose the temperature rise index (TRI), a drought index that is comparatively robust and easy to calculate, as the anomaly of the intrinsic morning rise of LST. The underlying principle is that the rate of LST rise between 1.5 and 3.5 h after the sunrise is approximately linear and occurs more rapidly under dry conditions than under wet conditions over vegetated surfaces as a consequence of stomatal control. TRI during the growing seasons of 2010-2014 was calculated over the Australian wheatbelt from LST retrievals from the geostationary Multifunction Transport Satellite-2 (MTSAT-2) instrument. The calculated TRI was compared with indices based on precipitation integrated over 1-, 3- and 6-month time scales, on Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil moisture derived from passive microwave remote sensing, and on vegetation condition (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) derived from optical remote sensing. The various indices were also compared to annual wheat yield over large areas. The correlation coefficient between TRI and precipitation anomaly that serves as an operational drought index in Australia was above 0.6 in general with 3-month integrative time scale for precipitation. TRI produced spatiotemporal dryness patterns that were very similar to those in soil moisture, but with more detail due to its finer resolution. A time lag of > 1 month was found between TRI and observed vegetation condition, supporting the use of TRI in early warning. Among the compared drought indices, TRI explained the largest fraction (35%) of wheat yield variations. TRI correlations with wheat yields peaked higher and earlier by almost one month in comparison to other indices. We conclude that the thermal drought index proposed here shows considerable potential for use in drought early warning as an effective complement.', '[Hu, Tian; Xu, Zhihong; Zhou, Jun; Liu, Tengjiao] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.

However, moving back more than a thousand years, the real pioneers of remote observation were probably the Nasca, a pre-Hispanic civilization living in southern Peru, between 100BC and 700 AD. They used \'earth observation\' as a mean of cultural expression drawing the geoglyphs (known as Nasca Lines) only visible from above. These drawings were made on flat desert surface of the Pampa by removing or clearing sand or stones, to create paths for ritual functions to please the gods and create harmonious relationships between man and environment. In this paper, the Nasca geoglyphs in Pampa de Atarco, are object of remote sensing based investigations with the twofold aim to identify and characterize them as well as to analyse and monitor their fragile state of conservation, threatened mainly by vandalism and off road vehicles. The approach herein proposed includes the integration and reuse of diverse remote sensing dataset, from multispectral satellite to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based ISAR data and close range photogrammetry. In particular, a multidate (2002-2013) very high resolution (VHR) optical satellite dataset has been processed in the spatial and temporal domain using textural indicators, including Skewness, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and automatic classification tools which allowed us to enhance the visibility of disturbance features and to automatically extract them. The best results in terms of enhancement and automatic extraction capability of disturbance features have been obtained by Skewness. Moreover, the reuse of UAV L SAR-based correlation map, available free of charge from NASA, provided useful information on the state of disturbance from 2013 to 2015, widening the observation time window of the VHR satellite data set from 2002 to 2013. Finally, the integrated use of satellite VHR data with UAV-based photographs and DTMs, processed using structure from motion (SfM), allowed us to characterize, identify and reconstruct the relative chronological sequence of geoglyphs thus providing new insights and opening new perspectives for archaeological studies.', '[Masini, Nicola] CNR, ISPC, Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Sci Cultural Heritage, I-85050 Potenza, Italy.

Allometric equations and relative growth rate functions were combined to establish the linkage between tree biomass and forest stand age. We also modeled the spatial distribution of tree biomass using a conventional remote sensing (CRS) method that only utilizes spectral and textural variables and an extended CRS method that incorporates stand age (CRS_EX). We then compared the CRS and CRS_EX methods with the allometric analysis method to highlight the importance of stand age and post-disturbance forest regrowth for biomass estimation. The Landsat-derived disturbance history was significantly correlated with stand age (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 3.7 year, p < 0.01). The CRS_EX and allometric analysis methods substantially improved tree biomass estimates (R-CRS_EX(2) = 0.77, RMSECRS_Ex = 37.7 t/ha; R-Allometric(2) = 0.70, RMSEAllometric = 43.5 t/ha) compared to the CRS method (R-CRS( )2= 0.53, RMSE (CRS) = 54.38 t/ha). Tree biomass estimated from the allometric analysis method aligned better with the allometric growth curves, while CRS_EX and CRS methods both exhibited notable overestimation for young and mid-aged forests. This study suggests that allometric models have the potential to be applied in subtropical forest plantations through the use of the existing forest stand development knowledge and increasingly open access remote sensing data.', '[Fang, Lei; Zhang, Wenqiu; Zhang, Weidong; Yan, Qiaoling] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China.

However, wood properties are highly variable between and within trees due to the complexity of wood formation. Therefore, tree-specific field references and spatially transferable models are required to capture the variability of wood quality and forest biomass at multiple scales, entailing high-resolution terrestrial and aerial remote sensing methods. Here, we aimed at identifying select tree traits that indicate wood properties (i.e. wood quality indicators) with a combination of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) in an examination of 27 even-aged, managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in southern Finland. We derived the wood quality indicators from tree models sampled systematically from TLS data and built prediction models with respect to individual crown features delineated from ALS data. The models were incapable of predicting explicit branching parameters (height of the lowest dead branch R-2 = 0.25, maximum branch diameter R-2 = 0.03) but were suited to predicting stem and crown dimensions from stand, tree, and competition factors (diameter at breast height and sawlog volume R 2 = 0.5, and live crown base height R-2 = 0.4). We were able to identify the effect of canopy closure on crown longevity and stem growth, which are pivotal to the variability of several wood properties in managed forests. We discussed how the fusions of high-resolution remote sensing methods may be used to enhance sustainable management and use of natural resources in the changing environment.', '[Pyorala, Jiri; Saarinen, Ninni; Kankare, Ville; Holopainen, Markus] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, BoPOB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.

In environments where livelihoods depend on surface-water storage (SWS) structures, satellite altimetry-derived water levels are often unavailable. Therefore, seasonal reservoirs require a robust and cost-effective approach for estimating SWS. To approximate SWS throughout a typical environmental setting where irrigation reservoirs are found, we investigate the utility of TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM) to extract bathymetry of seasonal reservoir structures. Empirically-derived SWS relationships are combined with estimates of SW area from radar and multisource optical satellites to illustrate the potential for rapid SWS estimation using satellite-based SW extent as input. Two application examples illustrate the approach: (i) estimating the maximum volume of water in a southern Indian river basin for two monsoon seasons; and (ii) a time-series analysis using a high-volume of satellite observations to show the cycle of water (inflow and outflow) at the reservoir scale. SWS volumes at water levels below 1.5 m were estimated within an absolute volume error range of 6-8%. This study illustrates the applicability and challenges of using satellite remote sensing observations to continuously monitor reservoir SWS. Despite the cloud independent capability for operational monitoring of SW area, Sentinel-1 data should be combined with frequent and high spatial resolution CubeSat observations for hydrometric monitoring of reservoirs to reduce observation errors. Furthermore, we highlight the multi-sensor approach (optical and radar) to achieve high spatio-temporal resolution monitoring of small reservoirs over large spatial scales.', '[Vanthof, Victoria; Kelly, Richard] Univ Waterloo, Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.', 'University of WaterlooRP Vanthof, V (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.', 'vrvantho@uwaterloo.ca', 'Kelly, Richard/0000-0001-8076-7604', 'Natural Science and Engineering Council\'s Discovery Grant program;   University of Waterloo\'s International Research Partnerships Grant', 'The authors acknowledge the support from the Natural Science and   Engineering Council\'s Discovery Grant program, seed funding from the   University of Waterloo\'s International Research Partnerships Grant, and   from DLR (Germany) for access to TanDEM-X DEM data under the successful   proposal DEM_HYDR0751.

Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) addresses the issue by providing valuable sub-pixel information. However, it is affected by endmember variability exhibiting diverse spectral characteristics for the same endmember, inducing substantial uncertainties in model estimations. A number of approaches have been proposed to reduce the uncertainties, but theoretical explanations of how endmember variability affects model estimation and how these approaches perform successfully have not yet been derived. In this study, error propagation caused by endmember variability in linear SMA (LSMA) was investigated using theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. The major findings are as follows: (1) the impact of endmember variability on LSMA unmixing error depends on the interactions between deviation signal and gain vectors in a multiplicative way. (2) Unmixing error originates from the deviation signal that is governed jointly by spectral variability within an endmember class (i.e., intra-class variability) and endmember abundances, while spectra magnitude and spectral similarity among different endmember classes (i.e., inter-class variability) can amplify or reduce the deviation signal. (3) The typical approaches for mitigating endmember variability could not only change the deviation signal but also affect gain vectors, resulting in improved performance of LSMA to some extent. Based on these results, we recommend Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to be used in most applications considering its robustness in mitigating endmember variability. The results of this study will be of benefit to the application of LSMA in practice.', '[Zhang, Chishan; Chen, Jin; Chen, Xuehong] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Inst Remote Sensing Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

At the same time, there is an increasing demand for the uncertainties associated with these products, which has to be determined through rigorous validation studies. This study validated seven global LAI products - EPS, GEOV2, GLASS, GLOBMAP, MODIS, PROBA-V, and VIIRS - over typical agricultural croplands in northeastern China. Seasonal continuous LAI measurements were obtained from field campaigns in paddy rice fields in 2012 and 2013, and in maize, soybean, and sorghum fields in 2016. High resolution reference LAI maps were first derived from HJ-1, Landsat 7, and Sentinel-2A images with the look-up table (LUT) inversion method and were evaluated with the field measured LAI (R-2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 0.66). Subsequently, the moderate resolution LAI products were validated with the upscaled high resolution reference LAI.   All LAI products show typical seasonal variation patterns of agricultural crops, but distinct differences exist among the products. The product quality indicators show large deviations during the peak growing season, whereas the relative uncertainties are higher during the green-up and senescent phases. Both EPS and GLASS show some saturation effects at LAI similar to 4.0 and underestimate the reference LAI (> 0.5), whereas GLOBMAP shows the largest overestimation (bias = 0.96). GEOV2 and PROBA-V significantly overestimate the LAI for all crops. In contrast, MODIS and VIIRS underestimate and show high variations (RMSE >1.50, RRMSE >47%) compared with the reference LAI. In general, the global moderate resolution LAI products show moderate agreement with the reference LAI (RMSE: 0.80-2.0 and RRMSE: 25-60%). The product uncertainties are higher over paddy rice fields than those over the other crop fields. The uncertainties are mainly attributed to the lack of regional tuning of the global algorithms for agricultural crops at different growth stages. Further algorithm improvement and validation studies are necessary to improve the global LAI products for regional applications.', '[Fang, Hongliang; Zhang, Yinghui; Wei, Shanshan; Li, Wenjuan; Ye, Yongchang; Sun, Tao; Liu, Weiwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, LREIS, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Pioneering images from infrared scanning radiometers revealed the complexity of the surface temperature fields, but these were derived from radiance measurements at orbital heights and included the effects of the intervening atmosphere. Corrections for the effects of the atmosphere to make quantitative estimates of the SST became possible when radiometers with multiple infrared channels were deployed in 1979. At the same time, imaging microwave radiometers with SST capabilities were also flown. Since then, SST has been derived from infrared and microwave radiometers on polar orbiting satellites and from infrared radiometers on geostationary spacecraft. As the performances of satellite radiometers and SST retrieval algorithms improved, accurate, global, high resolution, frequently sampled SST fields became fundamental to many research and operational activities. Here we provide an overview of the physics of the derivation of SST and the history of the development of satellite instruments over half a century. As demonstrated accuracies increased, they stimulated scientific research into the oceans, the coupled ocean-atmosphere system and the climate. We provide brief overviews of the development of some applications, including the feasibility of generating Climate Data Records. We summarize the important role of the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) in providing a forum for scientists and operational practitioners to discuss problems and results, and to help coordinate activities world-wide, including alignment of data formatting and protocols and research. The challenges of burgeoning data volumes, data distribution and analysis have benefited from simultaneous progress in computing power, high capacity storage, and communications over the Internet, so we summarize the development and current capabilities of data archives. We conclude with an outlook of developments anticipated in the next decade or so.', '[Minnett, P.

Because the seasonal changes in the rate of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation are linked to changes in carotenoid pigment composition, it has been suggested that carotenoid sensitive vegetation indices might be used to track the otherwise \"invisible\" phenology of photosynthesis of conifer forests through remote sensing of leaf spectral reflectance. In this study we aimed to assess differences in the seasonal regulation of photosynthesis and the associated variation of carotenoids and chlorophylls at the leaf-scale for eastern white pine, red maple and white oak, in order to understand if photosynthetic and photoprotective processes are adequately represented by different vegetation indices over the course of the year. For this purpose we measured maximum rates of CO2 assimilation (A(max)), quantified photosynthetic pigments, estimated photochemical and non-photochemical quenching processes via chlorophyll fluorescence and determined leaf spectral reflectance in pine, maple and oak trees over the course of two years. Seasonal variation in A(max), used here as a proxy for photosynthetic phenology, and photosynthetic pigments were adequately represented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the deciduous trees. For pine, NDVI overestimated photosynthetic activity for most of the year and was hence not able to represent photosynthetic phenology, due to the fact that needle chlorophyll content shows only little variation over the course of the year. By contrast, using the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and the chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI), which both detect variations in carotenoids, we were able to observe an improved representation of the seasonal variation of CO2 assimilation and photosynthetic phenology for the two deciduous and the conifer species. Based on the accurate detection of the seasonal regulation of leaf-scale photosynthetic activity for all three species, we conclude that carotenoid-sensitive vegetation indices are promising tools to improve monitoring of phenology in both deciduous and conifer forests.', '[Wong, Christopher Y.

The importance of thermal radiation directionality (TRD) is being more and more widely recognized in the applications because of the magnitude of the effects generated. The effects of TRD were originally evidenced through experiments in 1962, showing that two sensors simultaneously measuring temperature of the same scene may get significantly different values when the viewing geometry is different. Such effect limits inter-comparison of measurement datasets and land surface temperature (LST) products acquired at different view angles, while raising the question of measurement reliability when used to characterize land surface processes. These early experiments fostered the development of modeling approaches to quantify TRD with the aim of developing a correction for Earth surface TIR radiation. Initiatives for pushing the analysis of TIR data through modeling have been lasted since 1970s. They were initially aimed at mimicking the observed TIR radiance with consideration of canopy structure, component emissivities and temperatures, and Earth surface energy exchange processes. Presently, observing the Earth surface TRD effect is still a challenging task because the TIR status changes rapidly. Firstly, a brief theoretical background and the basic radiative transfer equation are presented. Then, this paper reviews the historical development and current status of observing TRD in the laboratory, in-situ, from airborne and space-borne platforms. Accordingly, the TRD model development, including radiative transfer models, geometric models, hybrid models, 3D models, and parametric models are reviewed for surfaces of water, ice and sea, snow, barren lands, vegetation and urban landscapes, respectively. Next, we introduce three potential applications, including normalizing the LST products, estimating the hemispheric upward longwave radiation using multi-angular TIR observations and separating surface component temperatures. Finally, we give hints and directions for future research work.

With this work we call this ranking into question. Usually, global city rankings are based on nationally collected population figures, which rely on administrative units. Sprawling urban growth, however, leads to morphological city extents that may surpass conventional administrative units. In order to detect spatial discrepancies between the physical and the administrative city, we present a methodology for delimiting Morphological Urban Areas (MUAs). We understand MUAs as a territorially contiguous settlement area that can be distinguished from low-density peripheral and rural hinterlands. We design a settlement index composed of three indicators (settlement area, settlement area proportion and density within the settlements) describing a gradient of built-up density from the urban center to the periphery applying a sectoral monocentric city model. We assume that the urban-rural transition can be defined along this gradient. With it, we re-territorialize the conventional administrative units. Our data basis are recent mapping products derived from multi-sensoral Earth observation (EO) data namely the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) and the GUF Density (GUF-DenS) - providing globally consistent knowledge about settlement locations and densities. For the re-territorialized MUAs we calculate population numbers using WorldPop data. Overall, we cover the 1692 cities with > 300,000 inhabitants on our planet. In our results we compare the consistently re-territorialized MUAs and the administrative units as well as their related population figures. We find the MUA in the Pearl River Delta the largest morphologically contiguous urban agglomeration in the world with a calculated population of 42.6 million. Tokyo, in this new list ranked number 2, loses its top position. In rank-size distributions we present the resulting deviations from previous city rankings. Although many MUAs outperform administrative units by area, we find that, contrary to what we assumed, in most cases MUAs are considerably smaller than administrative units. Only in Europe we find MUAs largely outweighing administrative units in extent.', '[Taubenboeck, H.; Weigand, M.; Esch, T.; Staab, J.; Wurm, M.; Mast, J.; Dech, S.] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.

Many of the SAR techniques adopted by SAR system designers worldwide as part of their toolkit, such as: ScanSAR, Spotlight mode, along-track interferometry, polarization diversity and polarimetry, polarimetric calibration, variable length and bandwidth pulses, and on-board processing, can trace their heritage back to this first-of-a-kind, civil use SAR system. The electronic steering capability of SIR-C\'s phased array antenna, combined with the exquisite orbit track control provided by the Space Shuttle, paved the way for systematic mapping of the Earth\'s topography by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, and later by TanDEM-X. Some techniques, such as multi frequency SAR, multi-frequency repeat-pass interferometry and onboard processing have yet to be fully exploited. The richness of the SIR-C/X-SAR data set has proved to be a treasure trove for opening up entirely new remote sensing techniques, such as Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (or PoIInSAR), and GPS, now GNSS, reflections (also known as Signals of Opportunity), which were both demonstrated from archive data, years after the 1994 flights.

In this study, we retrieved the annual glacier mass balance of the Puruogangri ice field, which is the largest modern ice mass in the ITP, by differencing multi-temporal digital elevation models (DEMs) generated with five pairs of TanDEM-X bistatic interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images acquired between April 2011 and January 2016. We compared the TanDEM-X DEMs in January and April 2012 to estimate the X-band radar penetration depth difference (0.61 +/- 0.06 m), which enabled systematic bias correction in the estimation of annual glacier mass balance. The observed mass balance reveals a glacier mass gain of 0.44 +/- 0.10 m w.e. yr(-1) in 2011-12, which was followed by accelerated glacier mass loss in 2012-16. Glacier mass balances of -0.13 +/- 0.03, -0.34 +/- 0.06, and -0.52 +/- 0.10 m w.e. yr(-1) were estimated for the periods of 2012-13, 2013-14, and 2014-16, respectively. This accelerating trend of glacier mass loss is likely caused by the continuous decrease in annual precipitation, according to the climate data recorded by adjacent meteorological stations.

Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have been widely applied in estimating daily PM2.5 concentrations over large areas using statistical regression models. However, they are often given at coarse spatial resolutions which limit their applications in small or medium scales. This study aims to produce PM2.5 concentrations at a high spatial resolution (1 km) across China based on the newly released Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD1S) Collection 6 Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD product using a newly developed space-time random forest (STRF) model. Daily PM2.5 concentrations for 2016 were estimated from in-situ surface PM2.5 measurements, and meteorological and ancillary variables. The 10-fold cross-validation (CV) approach and three popular models, including the multiple linear regression model, the geographically weighted regression model, and the two-stage model, are employed for validation and cross comparison. A sample-based CV of the STRF model shows a high and stable accuracy with a coefficient of determination equal to 0.85, a root-mean-square error of 15.57 mu g m(-3), and a mean prediction error of 9.77 mu g m(-3). This finding suggests that the STRF model can predict PM2.5 daily, monthly, and annual concentrations at an unprecedented spatial resolution and accuracy across China. It also appears to have out-performed the above popular models and the previous related studies. In general, the STRF model is robust and can accurately estimate PM2.5 concentrations by taking advantage of the ensemble regression approach, the synergy of space-time information, and the high-resolution, high-quality, and wide-spatial-coverage of the MAIAC AOD product. It may thus also be useful for applications in related air pollution studies, especially those focused on urban areas.', '[Wei, Jing; Xue, Wenhao] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Retrieval accuracy is highly variable and often unsatisfactory where Chla co-occurs with other optically active constituents. Furthermore, the applicability and limitations of retrieval algorithms across different optical complex systems in space and time are often not considered. In the first instance, this paper provides an extensive performance assessment for 48 Chla retrieval algorithms of varying architectural design. The algorithms are tested in their original parametrisations and are then retuned using in-situ remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda), sr(-1)) data (n = 2807) collected from 185 global inland and coastal aquatic systems encompassing 13 different optical water types (OWTs). The paper then demonstrates retrieval performance across the full dataset of observations and within individual OWTs to determine the most effective model(s) of those tested for retrieving Chla in waters with varying optical properties. The results revealed significant variability in retrieval performance when comparing model outputs to in-situ measured Chla for the full in-situ dataset in its entirety and within the 13 distinct OWTs. Importantly, retuning an algorithm to optimise its parameterisation for each individual OWT (i.e. one algorithm, multiple parameterisations) is found to improve the retrieval of Chla overall compared to simply calibrating the same algorithm using the complete in-situ dataset (i.e. one algorithm, one parameterisation). This resulted in a 25% improvement in retrieval accuracy based on relative percentage difference errors for the best performing Chla algorithm. Improved performance is further achieved by allowing model type and specific parameterisation to vary across OWTs (i.e. multiple algorithms, multiple parameterisations). This adaptive framework for the dynamic selection of in-water algorithms is shown to provide overall improvement in Chla retrieval across a continuum of bio-geo-optical conditions. The final dynamic ensemble algorithm produces estimates of (log(10)-transformed) Chla with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 and a mean absolute error of 0.18 mg m(-3). The OWT framework presented in this study demonstrates a unified approach by bringing together an ensemble of algorithms for the monitoring of inland waters at a global scale from space.', '[Neil, C.; Spyrakos, E.; Hunter, P.

However, parameterization of hydrodynamic models is challenging due to poor knowledge of bathymetry and lack of gauge data. In this study, we present an approach for calibrating spatially distributed Strickler coefficient and river datum simultaneously by regularized inversion. Calibration was carried out using altimetry derived observations of water surface elevation in the Songhua River (China). Synthetic experiments show that spatial variability of model parameters can be well constrained by geodetic altimetry, e.g., CryoSat-2 and SARAL, and to a lesser extent by Envisat and Jason-1. However, Jason-2 can only recover some of the parameters. We also find that a higher accuracy of observations does not proportionally decrease parameter uncertainty for all cross sections. Instead, high spatial sampling density helps to identify the spatial variability of parameters. Real-world calibrations indicate that CryoSat-2 by far outperforms other altimeters in terms of parameter identification. We conclude that high spatial resolution is more important than temporal resolution and observation accuracy for calibrating parameters of large-scale river models. The findings demonstrate the added value of geodetic satellite altimetry for inversion of spatially resolved parameter fields. This study is timely because the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission will significantly improve spatial and temporal resolution of spaceborne observations of water surface elevation, and hydraulic models need to be prepared for the uptake of these data.', '[Jiang, Liguang; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

The methodology evaluates the level of agreement of temporal change between these two Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) taking into account their uncertainties. Several configurations of surface albedo and burned area products, including the ones from MODIS Collection 6, Copernicus Global Land Service (C-GLS), Climate Change Initiative (CCI) and the GlobAlbedo, were analysed over the 2005-2011 period at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees spatial resolution. The study evaluates the temporal and spatial coherence level in the ECV changes, and explores the product dependency impact on the fire-driven radiative forcings. The main findings indicate that the level of agreement between these two ECVs depends on the product combination but also on the albedo broadband. Whereas both GlobAlbedo and MODIS albedo changes are consistent both temporally and spatially when combined with any burned area product, the C-GLS albedo changes are characterised by lower levels of agreement. The results also indicate that surface albedo and burned area product changes are physically coherent for all biomes except grasslands and croplands, when using the MODIS burned area product. Using different combinations of burned area and surface albedo products, fire-induced radiative forcing estimates at the surface can differ, according to the biome, by 26% to 46%. The proposed framework identifies lack of coherency and consistency between the two ECVs.

In this study, we revisited current BRDF definitions and updated them for rugged terrain with few dependent parameters: illumination and viewing geometries, terrain shadows, effective areas of illumination and observation, and anisotropic reflectance properties of subpixel-scale slopes. Furthermore, the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF), hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF), directional-hemispheric reflectance (DHR), and bi-hemispherical reflectance (BHR) were proposed within the current physical framework of reflectance quantities. These reflectance quantities have been adopted by the 3-D Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to provide the simulations of remote sensing images. To highlight the importance of a proper usage of such reflectance terms, we used DART simulations to present the topographic effects on these reflectance quantities.

Despite the > 40 years of inland water observations made possible by optical remote sensing, a standardized reflectance product for inland waters is yet forthcoming. The aim of this work is to compare the standard USGS land surface reflectance product to two Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 aquatic remote sensing reflectance products over the Amazon, Columbia and Mississippi rivers. Landsat-8 reflectance products from all three routines are then evaluated for their comparative performance in retrieving chlorophyll-a and turbidity in reference to ship borne, underway in situ validation measurements. The land surface product shows the best agreement (4% Mean Absolute Percent Difference) with field measurements of radiometry collected on the Amazon River and generates 36% higher reflectance values in the visible bands compared to aquatic methods (ACOLITE and SeaDAS) with larger differences between land and aquatic products observed in Sentinel-2 (0.01 sr(-1)) compared to Landsat-8 (0.001 sr(-1)). Choice of atmospheric correction routine can bias Landsat-8 retrievals of chlorophyll-a and turbidity by as much as 59% and 35% respectively. Using a more restrictive time window for matching in situ and satellite imagery can reduce differences by 5-31% depending on correction technique. This work highlights the challenges of satellite retrievals over rivers and underscores the need for future optical and biogeochemical research aimed at improving our understanding of the absorbing and scattering properties of river water and their relationships to remote sensing reflectance.', '[Kuhn, Catherine; Butman, David] Univ Washington, Dept Forestry & Environm Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

We apply this approach for JASON-3 nadir altimeter. First, locations were identified in South and South East Asia region as potential candidates for this approach based on river extent. Information on river extent composed of river width and course (i.e., path) from visible (Landsat) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) platform (Sentinel-1). The extent-based approach was applied to filter out non-water radar returns in two methods: 1) River Mask (RM) based K-means (KM) clustering (hence, RM + KM) and 2) K-means clustering embedded with River Mask (RM) (hence, KMRM). Both methods were validated over 12 locations with long records of in-situ height observations and with distinct river characteristics. The maximum benefit observed in utilizing dynamic river mask is during low flow season when the probability of non water radar signal contamination is highest. For highly varying seasonal widths, satellite imagery on river conditions, as an ensemble of techniques, yields heights with higher accuracy. An average RMSE improvement of 40% in 8 out of 12 stations is observed. Overall, at least one of the two dynamic mask-based techniques studied consistently outperformed the conventional technique of altimeter height extraction based on a fixed river mask. Information on river mask or extent can play an important role in highly meandering rivers as the deviation between actual satellite altimeter passes and nominal passes can be considered during the extraction of heights. Compared to visible (Landsat) imagery, SAR was found to be much more effective at improving altimeter height extraction because of the all-weather capability during frequently cloudy conditions. The practicality of the river mask-based approach for altimeter height extraction needs to be carefully considered by the operational end user based on available computational resources and the latency that can be afforded. An ensemble of morphology based techniques using SAR imagery is likely the future of satellite altimeter-based river height extraction in South and South-East Asia where rivers are increasingly impacted by human regulation, encroachment and seasonality.', '[Biswas, Nishan Kumar; Hossain, Faisal; Bonnema, Matthew] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Wilcox 167,Box 352700, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

A new time-series point-like target offset tracking (TS-PTOT) method is proposed to retrieve time-series surface displacements at point-like targets (PTs) from SAR image pairs properly combined with large temporal baselines and small spatial baselines. According to an evaluation of the standard deviation of time-series displacements at stable points, the TS-PTOT method increased the measurement precision of offset tracking by about 25% over the results using a single master. Our TSX-HS TS-PTOT results manifested a spatial pattern and magnitude of displacements highly similar to DInSAR result produced with an ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 image pair. The maximum displacement rate at the upper part of the slope during the study period was around 80 cm/yr in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction, which is much lower than the displacement rate measured in 2010. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3D) displacements at those identified homologous PTs were estimated by combining two-dimensional (2D) displacements measured by TS-PTOT from the two SAR data stacks.

Mapping and monitoring their distribution is integral to understanding the ecology of kelp forests and to inform marine protected area planning. Canada\'s Pacific coast presents specific challenges to mapping canopy forming kelp with thousands of kilometers of coastline, complex topography, and a large tidal range. While in situ methods and manual interpretation of aerial photography are commonly used to map canopy-forming kelp at local or regional scales, these methods are prohibitively expensive for continued large-area application. Historical and current available inventories of kelp extent are therefore incomplete for Canada\'s Pacific Coast. The advent of Google Earth Engine, a cloud-computing platform with a repository of Landsat imagery, provides an opportunity to apply Landsat image archive analyses and integrate temporal compositing and filtering to obtain unprecedented data on historical and current kelp extents. However, the effects of the spatial resolution and temporal coverage for mapping canopy-forming kelp in regions with complex coastlines and large tidal ranges are unknown. The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) develop a tool within Google Earth Engine to automate the detection of kelp using the Landsat satellite image archive, and (2) quantify the associated limitations for mapping the surface extent of canopy-forming kelp by comparing Landsat derived kelp extent with extents derived from WorldView-2 satellite imagery. The results indicate that the overall accuracy of the developed method is high at 80% and very close in accuracy to WorldView-2 data, but no detection is feasible within approximately one 30 m pixel from the shoreline. The interaction between the spatial resolution, kelp bed size, and bed configuration affected the detected kelp extent, as did the tide level during image acquisition. For both sensors, a 2 m increase in tide resulted in a 40% decrease in kelp extent detected. The Google Earth Engine kelp mapping tool presented provides an efficient and transferable method for mapping canopy kelp extent, and the only currently available method to reconstruct coast wide kelp development for the past three decades. The presented tool has applications in conservation and management planning, for example in creating a baseline of past kelp extent and examining trends in kelp forest variability.', '[Nijland, Wiebe; Reshitnyk, Luba] Hakai Inst, Calvert Isl, BC, Canada.

Recognizing the differences in their spectral and spatial sampling, to generate a seamless data record for global water quality monitoring, it is critical to quantify how well the derived data products agree under various atmospheric and aquatic conditions. This study provides an extensive quantitative assessment of how Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/B equivalent data products compare and discusses implications on differences in downstream products generated via the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS). These products include the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (rho(t)), the remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs), as well as biogeochemical properties, such as the total suspended solids (TSS). The analyses are conducted a) for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/B near-simultaneous nadir overpasses (n-SNO) and b) over several highly turbid/eutrophic inland/nearshore waters. Following the implementation of vicarious gains for Sentinel-2A, the n-SNO analyses indicated that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A agree within +/- 1% in p, and +/- 5% in R-rs products across the visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Similar evaluations with preliminary vicarious gains for Sentinel-2B showed +/- 2% in rho(t) and 7% in R-rs products. Considering Landsat-8-derived R-rs products as a reference, we found < 5% difference in Sentinel-2A and -2B R-rs products. Analyses of combined TSS and R-rs time-series products over several aquatic systems further corroborated these results and demonstrated the remarkable value of combined products. Occasional negative retrievals of R-rs products over hypereutrophic and highly turbid waters suggest the need for improvements in the atmospheric correction procedure to empower science/application community to fully explore Landsat-Sentinel-2 products. With very similar absolute radiometric observations and products, the science community should consider developments of suitable biogeochemical algorithms to maximize the utility of merged Landsat-Sentinel-2 products.', '[Pahlevan, Nima; Chittimalli, Sandeep K.; Balasubramanian, Sundarabalan V.] NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr, 8800 Greenbelt Rd, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.

SMAP salinity anomaly data indicate that this event was related to a salty feature that moved along the northwestern Atlantic shelf break from near the Grand Banks southwest towards the GoM over eight months before entering the Gulf in December 2017 to January 2018. Satellite altimetry, sea surface salinity, and sea surface temperature data suggest that, before entering the GoM, the salty feature interacted with Gulf Stream meanders and eddies several times, helping to sustain the water mass. It is likely that feature interactions with a warm Gulf Stream meander took place in the fall of 2017, helping to advect high salinity water onto the shelf and then into the GoM as a surface trapped feature in late fall 2017. According to satellite salinity data, this episode led to significant salinification (about 1 psu) in the northeastern GoM. Interior GoM buoy salinity data agree in showing four months of increased GoM salinity of the upper 50 m starting in November 2017. Buoy T/S analyses characterize this surface inflow as modified warm Atlantic slope water, typically seen only below 100 m and previously unobserved at the surface in the 15-year buoy record. This new salty water circulated cyclonically along the GoM coastline and mixed into the deeper Gulf through February 2018. Its intrusion may have also enhanced the cyclonic winter circulation in the Gulf.

Satellite remote sensing (RS) has been established as an important source of information to determine the trophic state of inland waters through the retrieval of optically active water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). However, the use of RS techniques for assessment of the trophic state of inland waters on a global scale is hindered by the performance of retrieval algorithms over highly dynamic and complex optical properties that characterize many of these systems. In this study, we developed a new RS approach to assess the trophic state of global inland water bodies based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and the Forel-Ule index (FUI). First, the FIJI was calculated from MODIS data by dividing natural water colour into 21 indices from dark blue to yellowish-brown. Then the relationship between FIJI and the trophic state index (TSI) was established based on in-situ measurements and MODIS products. The water-leaving reflectance at 645 nm band was employed to distinguish coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)-dominated systems in the FIJI-based trophic state assessment. Based on the analysis, the FUI-based trophic state assessment method was developed and applied to assess the trophic states of 2058 large inland water bodies (surface area > 25 km(2)) distributed around the world using MODIS data from the austral and boreal summers of 2012. Our results showed that FUI can be retrieved from MODIS with a considerable accuracy (92.5%, R-2 = 0.92) by comparing with concurrent in situ measurements over a wide range of lakes, and the overall accuracy of the FIJI-based trophic state assessment method is 80.0% (R-2 = 0.75) validated by an independent dataset.

The initial LST algorithm, developed by Cook, was geographically restricted since the atmospheric inputs and truth data were limited to North America (Cook, 2014. Atmospheric Compensation for a Landsat Land Surface Temperature Product. Rochester Institute of Technology). The main objectives for this product are to produce an LST image for every available Landsat thermal image, and to also provide a per-pixel estimate of LST uncertainty. Various studies were performed in order to allow the LST algorithm to operate globally, after which a thorough global validation study was performed for Landsat 7 images. In this study, the LST algorithm was found to have an average error for all cases of -0.211 K compared to the MODIS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) product. For cases where transmission was less than 0.3 and clouds were within 1 km of the validation, the LST RMSE was 2.61 K. When transmission was at least 0.85 and clouds were more than 40 km away, the RMSE was 0.51 K. A LST uncertainty estimation method was developed that utilizes standard error propagation in combination with observed trends between LST error, transmission, and cloud proximity. When the uncertainty method was applied to the global validation dataset, 20% of the estimated LST uncertainties were less than 1 K and 63% were less than 2 K. LST uncertainty can be extended to other Landsat sensors pending small validation studies, and will be an extremely beneficial tool for users, since it allows them to select all pixels in an LST image that meet their accuracy requirements.', '[Laraby, Kelly G.; Schott, John R.] Rochester Inst Technol, Ctr Imaging Sci, 54 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.', 'Rochester Institute of TechnologyRP Laraby, KG (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Ctr Imaging Sci, 54 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.', 'kelly.laraby@eagleview.com; schott@cis.rit.edu', NULL, 'United States Geological Survey [G14AC00372]', 'This work was funded by the United States Geological Survey   (G14AC00372), in support of the development and validation of the   Landsat Surface Temperature product.

Surface reflectance anisotropy is characterized by the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). Within the past decade, spaceborne multiangle observations acquired by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor (which has a gridded spatial resolution of 500 m) and by the POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) sensor (which has a spatial resolution of 6 x 7 km) have been used for a wide variety of global applications. However, it is necessary to fully understand the variability inherent in the surface BRDF information as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER at these two spatial resolutions to optimize their use. In this study, we make use of extensive POLDER Bidirectional Reflectance Factors (BRFs) selected from the entire archive of the POLDER BRDF database and standard MODIS BRDF parameter products (MCD43A1, Collection V005) that were geolocated within the same spatial extents as the POLDER data. The variability in surface BRDF is characterized by investigation of three BRDF model parameters as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER and a comprehensive index indicating the variations in the primary dome-bowl BRDF patterns (the anisotropic flat index (AFX)). The principal information content contained in these BRDF data is characterized by the general BRDF shapes (the BRDF archetypes) that account for > 90% of the total variance in these BRDF data. A hotspotrevised BRDF model is used directly on top of the retrieved model BRDF parameters to capture the hotspot effect associated with these BRDF parameters. The main findings of this study show that the variability in surface BRDF, as extracted from the MODIS and POLDER datasets, shares six reciprocal BRDF archetypes. However, the 500-m MODIS BRDF data can uniquely capture some additional extreme BRDF shapes mainly due to the data\'s finer pixel scales. These original findings are very important, because subsequent albedo retrievals can be significantly impacted by the use of BRDFs of different resolutions. This study provides evidence concerning the influence of spatial resolution on angular variation patterns of optical reflectance as retrieved from the MODIS and POLDER BRDF products.', '[Jiao, Ziti; Zhang, Xiaoning; Dong, Yadong; Cui, Lei; Yin, Siyang; Ding, Anxin; Wang, Jindi] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

There are a number of differences between the sensor data that need to be considered before the data can be used together reliably. Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 data for approximately 10 degrees x 10 degrees of southern Africa acquired in two summer (December and January) and in two winter (June and July) months of 2016 were compared. The data were registered and each orbit projected into 30 m fixed non-overlapping tiles defined in the sinusoidal equal area projection. Only corresponding sensor observations of each 30 m tile pixel that were both not cloudy, shadow, saturated, or cirrus contaminated, and that were acquired within one-day of each other, were compared. Both the Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data were atmospherically corrected using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) and were also corrected to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (NBAR). Top of atmosphere (TOA), surface reflectance, and NBAR, for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) MSI and OLI bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (from the narrow NIR band for MSI), were compared and their sensor differences quantified by regression analyses. Atmospheric contamination and bi-directional reflectance differences were evident in the 65 million pairs of contemporaneous MSI and OLI observations considered. The MSI surface reflectance was greater than the OLI surface reflectance for all the bands except the green, red, and the broad MSI NIR bands, and the MSI surface NDVI was greater than the OLI surface NDVI. This pattern was also found in the NBAR sensor comparisons except for the red bands. Simulated MSI and OLI reflectance derived using the sensor spectral response functions and laboratory spectra showed similar results in the red, NIR and SWIR bands as the real data comparisons. Ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions of the 65 million pairs of contemporaneous MSI and OLI data for the three processing levels had good fits (r(2) > 0.87 for the TOA data comparisons, r(2) > 0.89 for the atmospherically corrected data comparisons, r(2) > 0.90 for the NBAR data comparisons; p-values < 0.0001).

The vegetation optical depth (VOD) parameter measures this attenuation. VOD could be a valuable source of information on agroecosystems, especially at lower frequencies for which greater portion of the vegetation canopy contributes to the observed brightness temperature. In the past, visible-infrared indices have been used to provide yield estimates based on measuring the photosynthetic activity from the surface canopy layer. These indices are affected by clouds and apply only in the presence of solar illumination. In this study we instead use the L-band microwave radiometer on board of the SMAP mission that provides VOD estimates in all weather and regardless of illumination. This study proposes a series of L-band VOD metrics for crop yield assessment using the first annual cycle of SMAP data (April 2015 to March 2016) over north-central United States. Maps of yield and crop proportion from the US Department of Agriculture are compared to VOD retrieved from SMAP with the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA). The yield-VOD relationship is explored using principal components regressions. Results show that 66% of yield variance is explained over the whole region by the first principal component (PC1). In corn-soy crops, PC1 explains 78% of yield amount, and maximum, standard deviation, and range of VOD capture the yield spatial patterns. Mixture of crops and scene heterogeneity reduced the unique relationships between VOD metrics and yield for specific crops. Hence, in wheat and mixed crops, PC1 explains 43% of yield variance. Results suggest that complementary information on maximum biomass, growth rate, and VOD amplitude can provide robust yield estimates, and that the uncertainty of these estimates depends on crop composition and heterogeneity. This study provides evidence that L-band VOD metrics can potentially be used to enhance crop yield forecasts.', '[Chaparro, David; Vall-Llossera, Merce; Camps, Adriano] Univ Politecn Cataluna, CommSensLab, Jordi Girona 1-3, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain.

However, in current databases, a significant number of ground-based multi-angular measurements contain either no corrections or only approximate corrections for atmospheric effects. Thus, the blended diffuse light in the total incident irradiance will result in considerable smoothing of the reflectance anisotropy retrieved by the kernel-driven model unless an atmospheric correction process is conducted. In this study, we propose a diffuse light correction (DLC) form of the kernel-driven model that improves its ability to process multi-angular measurements blended with hemispherical diffuse light. The DLC form of the kernel-driven model can be used to retrieve the intrinsic reflectance anisotropy of the observed target from atmospheric-uncorrected multi-angular measurements. This study used multi-angular data simulated by the PROSAIL and Radiosity Applicable to Porous IndiviDual objects (RAPID) BRDF model, atmospheric-corrected Polarization and Directionality of the Earth\'s Reflectances (POLDER), Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) multi-angular measurements and their simulated data based on the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) tools to validate the effectiveness of the DLC form of the kernel-driven model. The results indicated that the reflectance factors directly retrieved by the kernel-driven model are considerably smoothed by the blended diffuse light, especially in hotspot regions. Even under clear and cloudless sky conditions, the retrieved hotspot reflectance in the red band is still underestimated by an average of 9.25%, 7.72%, 11.0% and 13.8% for the PROSAIL, RAPID, POLDER and CAR data, respectively. In contrast, the hotspot reflectance retrieved by the DLC form of the kernel-driven model is very close to the intrinsic reflectance anisotropy of the targets; the average relative by the of the DLC form of the kernel-driven model is only 1.99%, 1.50%, 4.57% and 3.42%, respectively. Although the reflectance reconstructed by the DLC form of the kernel-driven model in the hotspot region represents a considerable improvement compared with the reflectance retrieved by the original kernel-driven model, its improvement on the root mean square error (RMSE) and the bias of the entire datasets is not very apparent. Using the DLC form of the kernel-driven model can significantly improve the ability of the kernel-driven model to process multi-angular measurements blended with hemispherical diffuse irradiance.', '[Dong, Yadong; Jiao, Ziti; Ding, Anxin; Zhang, Xiaoning; Li, Yang; He, Dandan; Yin, Siyang; Cui, Lei] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

In this paper, through developing a voxel-based gap size (VGS) algorithm, we compared the TLS-based forest canopy CIs with the ones obtained using the digital hemispherical photography (DHP)-based and tracing radiation and architecture of canopy (TRAC)-based approaches. Moreover, we investigated the effects of incident directions of solar beams, voxel size, and woody canopy components on the final retrieval accuracy of forest canopy CIs. Our results showed that: (1) TLS -based CIs accounted for 81% (N = 30, p < 0.001) of variations in the DHP-based method. (2) the anisotropic nature of forest canopy CIs suggested that a relatively comprehensive TLS data of a forest canopy was required to investigate the 3-D spatial variations of forest gap size distributions and CIs.

However, their spatial and temporal characteristics are still poorly represented. In this study, we used satellite observations of sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) to estimate top-of-canopy photosynthetic capacity (maximum carboxylation rate, V-cmax at a reference temperature of 25 degrees C) for crops, which was in turn utilized to simulate regional gross primary production (GPP). We first estimate the key parameter, in the widely-used FvCB photosynthesis model using field measurements of CO2 and water fluxes during 2007-2012 at seven crop eddy covariance flux sites over the US Corn Belt. The results showed that satellite far-red SIF retrievals have a stronger link to V-cmax at the seasonal scale (R-2 = 0.70 for C4 and R-2 = 0.63 for C3 crop) as compared with widely-used vegetation indices. We calibrate an empirical model linking V-cmax with SIF that was used to estimate spatially and temporally varying crop V-cmax for the US Corn Belt region. The resulting V-cmax maps are used together with meteorological data from MERRA reanalysis data and vegetation structural parameters derived from the satellite-based spectral reflectance data to constrain the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) balance model in order to estimate regional crop GPP. Our results show a substantial improvement in the seasonal and spatial patterns of cropland GPP when compared with crop yield inventory data. The evaluation with tall tower atmospheric CO2 measurements further supports our estimation of spatiotemporal V-cmax from space-borne SIF. Considering that SIF has a direct link to photosynthetic activity, our findings highlight the potential to infer regional using remotely sensed SIF data and to use this information for a better quantification of regional cropland carbon cycles.', '[Zhang, Yongguang; Song, Lian] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

The connection between SIF and photosynthesis allows its use for improving estimates of gross primary production (GPP) and monitoring plant stress. In these analyses, up-scaling of the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis from the photosynthetic level to the canopy, regional or global scale has been one of the main challenges. The scaling is strongly affected by the radiative transfer of emitted SIF, notably scattering and re-absorption of SIF. It is essential to understand these processes in order to differentiate effects of canopy structural variation from effects of photosynthesis functional variation on SIF. In this study, we derive the relationship between canopy scattering of SIF and top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance analytically, by investigating the radiative transfer of incident light and emitted SIF. The similarity of radiative transfer of intercepted incident light and emitted SIF results in a simple relationship between reflectance and canopy scattering of SIF. In particular, we find that the ratio of far-red reflectance (R) to the product of canopy interceptance (i(0)) and leaf albedo (omega) is an accurate estimate of canopy scattering of far-red SIF (i.e.,). SCOPE model simulations are used to validate our findings. The relationship we found provides an easy and accurate approach for rapid decoupling canopy structural and functional regulation of SIF, and correction of SIF for bidirectional effects. This will improve estimates of canopy photosynthesis from SIF.', '[Yang, Peiqi; van der Tol, Christiaan] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.', 'University of TwenteRP Yang, PQ (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.', 'p.yang@utwente.nlRI Yang, Peiqi/AAY-5147-2020; van der Tol, Christiaan/A-2403-2010', 'Yang, Peiqi/0000-0003-4377-8560; van der Tol,   Christiaan/0000-0002-2484-8191', 'China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201406040058]', 'This work of the first author (Peiqi Yang) was supported by the China   Scholarship Council (CSC) under Grant 201406040058.

Unmanned Aerial Systems WAS) are fast establishing themselves as a promising additional remote sensing platform that provides high spatial resolution not only of topography but also surface types and coastal features together with comparatively low costs and high deployment flexibility. However, comprehensive information on the accuracy of UAS-based elevation models in comparison to other available surveying methodology is regulary limited to be referenced to individual methods. This paper addresses this shortcoming by comparing coincident beach surveys of three different point cloud generating methods: ATV mounted mobile laser scan (MLS), airborne LiDAR (ALS), and UAS. This was complemented by two RTK-GPS surveys on a pole with wheel attachment and mounted on an ATV.   We present results in relation to elevation accuracies on a concrete control surface, the entire beach and for six different beach surface types together with how differences between point clouds propagate during the construction of gridded elevation models. Overall, UAS point cloud elevations were consistently higher than those of ALS (+ 0.063 m) and MLS (+ 0.087 m). However, these results for the entire beach mask larger and smaller differences related to the individual surface characteristics. For all surface types, UAS records higher (from 0.006 m for wet sand to 0.118 m for cobbles, average of 0.063 m) elevations than ALS. The MLS on the other hand, records predominantly lower elevation than ALS (- 0.005 m for beach gravel to - 0.089 m for soft mud, average of - 0.025 m) except for cobbles, where elevations are 0.056 m higher.   The comparison shows that all point cloud methods produce elevations that are suitable for monitoring changes in beach topography in the context of operational coastal management applications. However, due to the systematic differences between respective monitoring approaches, care needs to be taken when analysing beach topographies for the same area based on different methods.   The eventual choice of monitoring method is therefore guided by a range of practical factors, including capital cost of the system and operating costs per survey area, conditions under which the system can operate, data processing time, and legal restrictions in the use of the system such as air safety regulations or limitation of ground access to areas with environmental protection.', '[Elsner, Paul; Horn, Diane] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Geog Environm & Dev Studies, Motet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.

However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is similar to 9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.', '[Liu, Yongxue; Sun, Chao; Xu, Bihua; Dong, Yanzhu] Nanjing Univ, Dept Geog Informat Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

In the past, limitations in computing and archive capacity had restricted the MCD43 retrievals to only once every eight days. The latest reprocessing of the entire archive of Terra and Aqua MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo products (Collection V006) provide retrievals each day and therefore represent a major improvement for phonological and surface monitoring efforts. Compared to the previous retrieval which occurred every 8-days based on a 16-day retrieval period for Collection V005 MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo, this study demonstrates that the Collection V006 MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo product retrieved every day captures significantly more seasonal vegetation dynamics and rapid land surface changes. The Collection V006 product still utilizes the 16-days of directional reflectances surrounding the day of interest (9th day) to retrieve the model of the surface anisotropy but assigns the highest temporal weight to the day of interest (the center date of the retrieval period). Furthermore, the Collection V006 retrievals utilize the day of interest snow/snow-free status to capture snow albedo (an improvement over the previous Collection V005 strategy which based the retrieval on the predominant snow/snow-free status of the majority of the observations over the 16-day retrieval period). All valid clear sky observations from Terra and Aqua are now used for each retrieval, which improves the inversion quality. This is especially true at high latitudes, where up to nine observations from each sensor can be observed per day. Thus, although the high quality full inversion Collection V006 albedo retrieval values are consistent with the Collection V005 results, the overall number of high quality results retrieved has increased. Furthermore, the accuracy of the poorer quality magnitude inversions (which rely on a back-up algorithm) has improved due to utilization of the latest high quality full inversion retrievals as pixel-specific a priori knowledge. The ability of the latest Collection V006 MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo products to capture land surface dynamics is evaluated by using a globally-distributed record of spatially representative tower measurements. The RMSE of broadband shortwave blue-sky albedo at these sites is < 0.0318 and the bias is within +/- 0.0076 for all quality results.', '[Wang, Zhuosen] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Although many efforts have been made to resolve this dilemma, most have difficulties in generating diurnal fine-resolution LSTs with high spatial details for landscapes with significant heterogeneity and land cover type change. This study proposes an integrated framework to BLEnd Spatiotemporal Temperatures (termed BLEST) of Landsat, MODIS and a geostationary satellite (FY-2F) to one hour interval and 100 m resolution, where (1) a linear temperature mixing model with conversion coefficients is combined to better characterize heterogeneous landscapes and generate more accurate predictions for small and linear objects; (2) residuals are downscaled by a thin plate spline interpolator and restored to the primary fine-resolution estimations to include information about land cover type change; and (3) separate operations at annual and diurnal scales with nonlinear temperature modeling are designed to neutralize the hybrid impacts of large scale gap and land cover type change. BLEST was tested on both simulated data and actual satellite data at annual, diurnal and combined scales, and evaluations were conducted with the simulated/actual fine-resolution data, in-situ data, and with three popular fusion methods, i.e., the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), the Enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) and the spatiotemporal integrated temperature fusion model (STITFM). Results show higher accuracy by BLEST with more spatial details and pronounced temporal evolutions, particularly over heterogeneous landscapes and changing land cover types.

Yet applications of space-based remote sensing to monitoring of CDOM variability across estuarine ecosystems and assessment of DOC exchanges along highly dynamic terrestrial-aquatic interfaces have been scarce, in part due to the coarse spatial resolution of most existing ocean color sensors and the seasonal and regional dependence of most existing algorithms. Here, we used a rich dataset of field observations to develop and validate new CDOM and DOC algorithms that are broadly applicable to different estuarine and coastal regions, over different seasons and a wide range of in-water conditions. Algorithms were applied to satellite imagery from MERIS-Envisat at a spatial resolution (300 m) that can resolve much of the spatial variability that characterizes estuaries and their margins. Multi-spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) was used to retrieve CDOM absorption at various wavelengths and CDOM absorption spectral slope in the 275-295 nm spectral range (S275-295). DOC concentrations were obtained from a tight relationship between the DOC-specific CDOM absorption and S275-295, two optical quantities that depend only on the quality of CDOM and strongly covary across spatial and temporal scales. Algorithm evaluation using MERIS satellite data across different estuarine and coastal environments (i.e., the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Delaware Bay, the Chesapeake Bay estuary, and the Middle Atlantic Bight coastal waters) and across different seasons over multiple years resulted in relative errors (mean absolute percent difference; MAPD) of 29% (N = 17), 9.5% (N = 14), and 18% (N = 32), for a(CDOM)(300), S275-295, and DOC, respectively. These relative errors are comparable to those previously reported for satellite retrievals of CDOM and DOC products in less optically complex offshore waters. Application of these algorithms to multi-year MERIS satellite imagery over the Chesapeake Bay estuary allowed, for the first time, to capture the impact of tidal exchanges on carbon dynamics along wetland estuary interfaces, and resolved spatial gradients, seasonal variability, and year-to-year changes in estuarine carbon amount and quality associated with marsh carbon export, riverine inputs, and extreme precipitation events.', '[Cao, Fang; Tzortziou, Maria] CUNY City Coll, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, New York, NY 10031 USA.

For regular monitoring of large areas, wall-to-wall ALS data is economically prohibitive. However, when data are acquired in a strip-sampling mode, ALS can support the estimation of forest resources on large areas such as counties, states, and nations. This study investigated the combined use of ALS data acquired along parallel strips and co-located field observations of live and standing dead trees to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) at regional and sub-regional levels. The study area comprised the Tanana Inventory Unit (TIU) (138,566 km(2)), located in interior Alaska, and four sub-regions (106-7282 km(2)) within the TIU. The field data consisted of 1676 ground observations from six independent field campaigns. Ninety-four plots came from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the USDA Forest Service. The FIA plots, each consisting of four 1/60 ha subplots, were acquired using a probabilistic sampling design. The remaining ground observations were collected during field inventories across TIU, and consisted of 335 independent field plots and 257 clusters containing up to four plots each. The estimation procedure followed a two-phase sampling design grounded within a hybrid inferential framework, which combines design-based estimation for the first phase and model-based inference in the second phase. Post-stratified estimation by land cover class indicated that the hybrid estimation obtained 11-55% better precision compared to direct (design based) estimation based solely on field observations. When the field sample sizes were reduced to 25%, the standard errors for the hybrid estimation increased by 3 to 5 pp. Direct and hybrid estimates were compared for two sub-regions, and the hybrid estimated AGBs were 6.4% and 13.3% larger than the direct estimates. On both these study sub-regions, the 95% confidence interval of the hybrid estimated mean AGB included the direct estimate of the mean and vice versa.', '[Ene, Liviu T.; Gobakken, Terje; Naesset, Erik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.

However, in areas with complex topography, illumination effects affect the retrieval of such indices from high spatial resolution airborne or satellite data. Irradiance components at the pixel level are determined by atmospheric composition, as well as instantaneous illumination-surface-sensor geometries. An accurate pixel-wise description of direct and diffuse irradiance components is necessary to perform atmospheric corrections, finally resulting in improved surface reflectances and hence products. We assess three atmospheric correction strategies, differing in their approaches to simulate instantaneous as well as pixel-wise abundances of diffuse and direct irradiance. We use physically-based approaches in combination with either digital elevation models (DEM), fine resolution digital object models (DOM), or 3D modelling output from the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. The such obtained top-of-canopy reflectances at the Laegern test-site in Switzerland, are used to assess retrieval improvement for a set of indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), as well as chlorophyll and carotenoid indices). We demonstrate that both, the DOM and the DART based approach, improve the retrievals for flat cast-shadows by <= 71% compared to using a DEM.

The MJO index was calculated from long term 1997-2013 GPCP precipitation and ERA-Interim 850-hPa and 250-hPa zonal winds. The composites of soil moisture anomalies over eight MJO phases were mapped and analyzed. In order to distinguish the MJO signal with other patterns of climate variability, only MJO event days are used in the composites. In addition, the statistical significance of the anomaly composites is estimated using the Student\'s t-test. The MJO has been found to be the prominent source of the intraseasonal variation of the monsoon systems, which induces the variations of precipitation. Our results show that the variation of soil moisture between MJO phases also agrees well with the variation of the monsoon systems. In addition to the monsoon regions, the MJO also affects soil moisture over other areas such as East Africa. The relation between the soil moisture and precipitation anomaly composites across the MJO phases was also investigated. The results show that the variation of soil moisture over MJO phases is related to its connection to precipitation. In addition, large similarities were found between the GPCP-derived MJO index and the corresponding ESA CCI soil moisture composites, and ERA-Interim-derived MJO index and corresponding ERA-Interim soil moisture composites. This proves the feasibility of ERA-Interim datasets for MJO related studies. Owing to the different resolutions of the CCI and ERA-Interim soil moisture, CCI is more appropriate for regional and ERA-Interim dataset for large-scale MJO related analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Spectral mixing of features due to high data dimensionality and high inter-band correlations constitutes the biggest challenge in the analysis of MODIS. data. In view of this, present study attempts to develop a novel strategy involving Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Band to Band Correlation (BTBC) analysis, Stepwise Discriminant Analysis (SDA), and separability analysis to reduce the data dimensionality for extracting reliable and maximum information for wetland areal extent using coarse resolution MODIS (1 Inn) data. The PCA explains variability in data and removes data redundant information; BTBC analysis eradicates the high correlated bands providing best bands suitable for wetland mapping; SDA evaluates the discriminatory power of different MODIS bands to discriminate the wetlands from other class types. Further, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wetland Model Index (WMI) were also incorporated into the study to improve the classification accuracy. Finally, separability analysis was conducted to optimize the selected MODIS bands and indices.   Results of rigorous data mining reveal that out of 24 input layers of MODIS (1 km) data (22 optical MODIS bands, NDVI and WMI), only 4 input layers (WMI, NDVI, MODIS bands - NIR band 2 and SWIR band 6) are best suited for delineation and mapping of wetlands. This study also corroborates the usage of WMI, a newly developed index with combination of visible and short wavelength infra red (SWIR) MODIS bands, as the most optimal input layer to separate wetlands from the other land use class types (barren land, agricultural land, rivers/canals/streams, forest, wasteland/gullied or riverine land). It was observed that the magnitude of mapped wetland areal extent using MODIS (1 km) data varied from 105,053 ha in 2010-2011 to 111,479 ha in 2011-2012 accounting for 0.44% (2010-2011)-0.46% (2011-2012) of the total geographical area of Uttar Pradesh, India. Seasonally, monsoon season displayed maximum wetland area with overall accuracy of 92% whereas summer season exhibited minimum wetland area with overall accuracies varying from 85 to 87% during both the sampling years.

Correlations between radar parameters (polarized backscattering intensities, their ratios, entropy, and degrees of polarization) and remotely sensed ecological parameters (shrub cover, edge parameter, average shrub height, and biomass information) were analyzed for 52 least-disturbed sites along a climatic gradient between semi-arid and arid zones in the south-eastern Mediterranean. The degree of horizontal polarization (DOHP) was the RPP that was most highly correlated with all EPPs, while NDVIR biomass (NDVI multiplied by relative rainfall) was the EPP most highly correlated with all RPPs. Combinations of NDVIR biomass and DOHP data exhibited consistent inverse relationships for both the 52 least-disturbed sites as well as for the entire gradient. Mapping these combinations along the transition zone enabled differentiation of desert fringe areas and dense shrub and tree areas, with three transition typologies between the two. Although DOHP is instrumental in detecting changes in tall shrub coverage, it was found to be insufficiently sensitive to surface conditions in areas with dwarf shrubs and shrubs of biomass lower than 0.7 kg/m(2) at the end of the summer. Differentiation between the desert, desert fringe, and semi-arid margins of high DOHP values (> 0.9) was facilitated by differences in their NDVIR biomass. Areas of high anthropogenic influence on the landscape, i.e. abandoned terraces and low-density pine plantations, deviate significantly from the inverse DOHP and NDVIR biomass relationship, as both were characterized by low values in these parameterization. The wide extent of DOHP and NDVIR combinations representing desert fringe ecosystems and arid lands indicated a continuation of degradation processes in areas with rainfalls > 500 mm/year.

Over large areas land cover classification is challenging particularly due to the cost and difficulty of collecting representative training data that enable classifiers to be consistent and locally reliable. A novel methodology to classify large volume Landsat data using high quality training data derived from the 500 m MODIS land cover product is demonstrated and used to generate a 30 m land cover classification for all of North America between 20 degrees N and 50 degrees N. Publically available 30 m global monthly Web-enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) products generated from every available Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 5 TM image for a three year period, that are defined aligned to the MODIS land products and are consistently pre-processed data (cloud-screened, saturation flagged, atmospherically corrected and normalized to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance), were classified. The MODIS 500 m land cover product was filtered judiciously, using only good quality pixels that did not change land cover class in 2009, 2010 or 2011, followed by automated selection of spatially corresponding 30 m GWELD temporal metric values, to define a large training data set sampled across North America. The training data were sampled so that the class proportions were the same as the North America MODIS land cover product class proportions and corresponded to 1% of the 500 m and <0.005% of the 30 m pixels. Thirty nine GWELD temporal metrics for every 30 m North America pixel location were classified using (a) a single random forest, and (b) a locally adaptive method with a random forest classifier derived and applied locally and the classification results spatially mosaicked together. The land cover classification results appeared geographically plausible and at synoptic scale were similar to the MODIS land cover product. Detailed visual inspection revealed that the locally adaptive random forest classifications and associated classification confidences were generally more coherent than the single random forest classification results. The level of agreement between the 30 m classifications and the MODIS land cover product derived training data was assessed by bootstrapping the random forest implementation. The locally adaptive random forest classification had higher overall agreement (95.44%, 0.9443 kappa) than the single random forest classification (93.13%, 0.9195 kappa). The paper concludes with a discussion of future research including the potential for automated global land cover classification. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In many cases, this is due to the difficulty in measuring the spatial variation of the leaf angle distribution function. There is a critical need for a technique that can rapidly measure the leaf angle distribution function at any point in space and time. A new method was developed and tested that uses terrestrial LiDAR scanning data to rapidly measure the three-dimensional distribution of leaf orientation for an arbitrary volume of leaves. The method triangulates laser-leaf intersection points recorded by the LiDAR scan, which allows for easy calculation of normal vectors. As a byproduct, the triangulation also yields continuous surfaces that reconstruct individual leaves. In order to produce a probability density function for leaf orientation from triangle normal vectors, it is critical that the proper weighting be applied to each triangle. Otherwise, results will heavily bias toward normal vectors pointed toward the the LiDAR scanner. The method was validated using artificially generated LiDAR data where the exact leaf angle distributions were known, and in the field for an isolated tree and a grapevine canopy by comparing LiDAR-generated distribution functions to manual measurements. The artificial test cases demonstrated the consistency of the method, and quantitatively showed that errors in the predicted leaf angle distribution functions decreased as scan resolution was increased or as the density of leaves was increased. The isolated tree field validation showed qualitatively similar trends between manual and LiDAR measurements of distribution functions. Manual measurements of leaf orientation in the vineyard were shown to have large errors due to high leaf curvature, which illustrated the benefits of the more detailed LiDAR measurement method.

Indeed, the contribution of reflected radiation from adjacent pixels scattered into the field of view of a target pixel is considerable and can significantly affect the fidelity of retrieved reflectances. In this study, uncertainties and quantitative errors associated with the atmospheric correction of multi-spectral Landsat 8 and RapidEye data were characterized over a desert agricultural landscape in Saudi Arabia. Surface reflectances were retrieved using an implementation of the 6SV atmospheric correction code, and validated against field collected spectroradiometer measurements over desert, cultivated soil, and vegetated surface targets. A combination of satellite and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data were used to parameterize aerosol properties and atmospheric state parameters. With optimal specification of T550 and aerosol optical properties and correction for adjacency effects, the relative Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for all bands combined was 5.4% for RapidEye and 6.8% for Landsat 8. However uncertainties associated with satellite-based T-550 retrievals were shown to introduce significant error into the reflectance estimates. With respect to deriving common vegetation indices from corrected reflectance data, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was associated with the smallest errors (3-8% MAD). Surface reflectance errors were highest for bands in the visible part of the spectrum, particularly the blue band (5-16%), while there was more consistency within the red-edge (similar to 5%) and near-infrared (5-7%). Results were generally better constrained when a T-550-dependent aerosol model for desert dust particles, parameterized on the basis of nearby AERONET site data, was used in place of a generic rural or background desert model. This adaptation was particularly pertinent for the Landsat bands in the shortwave infrared. Failure to correct for adjacency effects increased the overall surface reflectance MAD to around 18%. The impact was especially significant for the visible bands over vegetated surface targets, as evidenced by relative MADs increasing to >200%. In comparison, a relatively minor adjacency effect was observed within the near-infrared and over the more reflective bare soil and desert sites. Overall, the impact of adjacency effects was substantial (20-25% MAD) for all of the studied vegetation indices. This investigation fills a research gap in the quantification of uncertainties and evaluation of achievable accuracy levels in high spatial resolution surface reflectance imagery over desert agriculture and highlights the need for accurate and regionally representative atmospheric correction techniques.

We interfaced a coupled meteorology-chemistry model (WRF-Chem) with a hybrid variational-ensemble DA system - the Maximum Likelihood Ensemble Filter (MLEF). The system is strongly coupled, in the sense that cross-covariances between meteorological and aerosol control variables are used in DA. Experiments are conducted for an Asian dust storm case that occurred over the Korean Peninsula on 13 May 2011, by assimilating both meteorological and aerosol observations. Meteorological observations include the conventional ones and the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) satellite radiances, whereas aerosol observations contain aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500nm from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). In the control experiment (CTNL), we assimilated only meteorological observations. In the AODDA experiment, we assimilated both AOD and meteorological observations. Control variables of DA include both meteorological and aerosol ones. Our results indicate that meteorological observations can partially contribute to the change of aerosol initial conditions and vice versa, implying a cross-component impact of observations, and hence improving the utility of observations in coupled DA. The forecast comparison indicates a consistently improved fit to AOD observations after 24 h of DA. In addition, uncertainty of the 24-hour aerosol forecast in AODDA decreases significantly in local regions - by up to similar to 21.6% in terms of innovations, and up to similar to 81.4% in terms of square root forecast error covariance. These results are encouraging for future applications of ensemble DA with strongly coupled meteorology-chemistry modeling system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This method was validated against ground-based FMF retrievals from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). The LUT-SDA was then applied to two MODIS-retrieved aerosol optical thickness (AOT) products for the period of December 2013 to July 2015: the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) Dark Target (DT) AOT product and the simplified high-resolution MODIS Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) AOT product. In comparison with the MODIS C6 FMF product in three study areas (Beijing, Hong Kong, and Osaka), FMFs estimated by the LUT-SDA agreed more closely with those retrieved from the AERONET with a very low bias. Eighty percent of the FMF values fell within the expected error range of +/- 0.4. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.168 with few anomalous values, whereas the RMSE for the MODIS FMF was 0.340 with more anomalous values. The LUT-SDA FMF estimated using SARA AOT data conveys more detailed information on urban pollution than that from MODIS C6 DT AOT data. As a demonstration, the seasonally-averaged spatial distribution of the FMF in Beijing was obtained from the LUT-SDA applied to SARA AOT data and compared with that of the AERONET-retrieved FMF. Their seasonal trends agreed well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The issue appears both as a non-uniform banding artifact across Earth scenes and as a varying absolute radiometric calibration error. A correction algorithm proposed by Montanaro et al. (2015) demonstrated great potential towards removing most of the stray light effects from TIRS image data. It has since been refined and will be implemented operationally into the Landsat Product Generation System in early 2017. The algorithm is trained using near-coincident thermal data (i.e., Terra/MODIS) to develop per-detector functional relationships between incident out-of-field radiance and additional (stray light) signal on the TIRS detectors. Once trained, the functional relationships are used to estimate and remove the stray light signal on a per-detector basis from a scene of interest.   The details of the operational stray light correction algorithm\"are presented here along with validation studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in removing the stray light artifacts over a stressing range of Landsat/FIRS scene conditions. Results show that the magnitude of the banding artifact is reduced by half on average over the current (uncorrected) product and that the absolute radiometric error is reduced to approximately 0.5% in both spectral bands on average (well below the 2% requirement). All studies presented here indicate that the implementation of the stray light algorithm will lead to greatly improved performance of the TIRS instrument, for both spectral bands.

Predominantly this is accomplished with either multi-spectral remote sensing data or through ground-based field sampling plots. While these methods are important, field data is usually limited to opportunistic post-fire observations, and spectral data often lacks validation with specific variables of change. Additional uncertainty remains regarding how best to account for environmental variables influencing fire effects (e.g., weather) for which observational data cannot easily be acquired, and whether pre-fire agents of change such as bark beetle and timber harvest impact model accuracy. This study quantifies wildfire effects by correlating changes in forest structure derived from multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) acquisitions to multi-temporal spectral changes captured by the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager for the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon. Spatial regression modeling was assessed as a methodology to account for spatial autocorrelation, and model consistency was quantified across areas impacted by pre-fire mountain pine beetle and timber harvest. The strongest relationship (pseudo-r(2) = 0.86, p < 0.0001) was observed between the ratio of shortwave infrared and near infrared reflectance (d74) and LiDAR-derived estimate of canopy cover change. Relationships between percentage of LiDAR returns in forest strata and spectral indices generally increased in strength with strata height. Structural measurements made closer to the ground were not well correlated. The spatial regression approach improved all relationships, demonstrating its utility, but model performance declined across pre-fire agents of change, suggesting that such studies should stratify by pre-fire forest condition. This study establishes that spectral indices such as d74 and dNBR are most sensitive to wildfire-caused structural changes such as reduction in canopy cover and perform best when that structure has not been reduced pre-fire.

However, few studies have examined the factors explaining differences in nighttime brightness of cities at a global scale. In this study, we derived quantitative estimates of nighttime lights with the new VIIRS sensor onboard the Suomi NPP satellite in January 2014 and in July 2014, with two variables: mean brightness and percent lit area. We performed a global analysis of all densely populated areas (n = 4153, mostly corresponding to metropolitan areas), which we defined using high spatial resolution Landscan population data. National GDP per capita was better in explaining nighttime brightness levels (0.60 < Rs < 0.70) than GDP density at a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees (0.25 < Rs < 0.43), or than a city-level measure of GDP per capita (in proportion to each city\'s fraction of the national population: 0.49 < Rs < 0.62). We found that in addition to GDP per capita, the nighttime brightness of densely populated areas was positively correlated with MODIS derived percent urban area (0.46 < Rs < 0.60), the density of the road network (0.51 < Rs < 0.67), and with latitude (0.31 <Rs <0.42) at p <0.001. NDVI values (representing vegetation cover) were found to be negatively correlated with cities\' brightness in winter time (-0.48 < Rs < 0.22), whereas snow cover (enhancing artificial light reflectance) was found to be positively correlated with cities\' brightness in winter time (0.17 < Rs < 0.35). Overall, the generalized linear model we built was able to explain >45% of the variability in cities\' nighttime brightness, when both physical and socio-economic variables were included. Within the generalized linear model, the percent of national GDP derived from income (rents) from natural gas and oil, was also found as one of the statistically significant variables. Our findings show that cities\' nighttime brightness can change with the seasons as a function of vegetation and snow cover, two variables affecting surface albedo.

The PRI is a normalized difference index based on spectral changes at a physiologically active wavelength (similar to 531 nm) as compared to a reference waveband, and is only available from a very few satellites. These include the two Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on the Aqua and Terra satellites each of which have a narrow (10 nm) ocean band centered at 531 nm. We examined several PRI variations computed with candidate reference bands, since MODIS lacks the traditional 570 nm reference band. The PRI computed using MODIS land band 1 (620-670 nm) gave the best performance for daily LUE estimation. Through rigorous statistical analyses over a large image collection (n = 420), the success of relating in situ daily tower-derived LUE to MODIS observations for northern forests was strongly influenced by satellite viewing geometry. LUE was calculated from CO2 fluxes (mol C mol(-1) absorbed quanta) measured at instrumented Canadian Carbon Program flux towers in four Canadian forests: a mature fir site in British Columbia, mature aspen and black spruce sites in Saskatchewan, and a mixed deciduous/coniferous forest site in Ontario. All aspects of the viewing geometry had significant effects on the MODIS-PRI, including the view zenith angle (VZA), the view azimuth angle, and the displacement of the view azimuth relative to the solar principal plane, in addition to illumination related variables. Nevertheless, we show that forward scatter sector views (VZA, 16 degrees-45 degrees) provided the strongest relationships to daily LUE, especially those collected in the early afternoon by Aqua (r(2) = 0.83, RMSE = 0.003 mol C mol(-1) absorbed quanta). Nadir (VZA, 0 15) and backscatter views (VZA, 16 to 45) had lower performance in estimating LUE (nadir: r(2) similar to 0.62-0.67; bacicscatter: r(2) similar to 0.54-0.59) and similar estimation error (RMSE = 0.004-0.005). When directional effects were not considered, only a moderately successful MODIS-PRI vs. LUE relationship (r(2) = 0.34, RMSE = 0.007) was obtained in the full dataset (all views & sites, both satellites), but site-specific relationships were able to discriminate between coniferous and deciduous forests. Overall, MODIS-PRI values from Terra (late morning) were higher than those from Aqua (early afternoon), before/after the onset of diurnal stress responses expressed spectrally. Therefore, we identified ninety-two Terra-Aqua \"same day\" pairs, for which the sum of Terra morning and Aqua afternoon MODIS-PRI values (PRIsum) using all available directional observations was linearly correlated with daily tower LUE (r(2) = 0.622, RMSE = 0.013) and independent of site differences or meteorological information. Our study highlights the value of off-nadir directional reflectance observations, and the value of pairing morning and afternoon satellite observations to monitor stress responses that inhibit carbon uptake in Canadian forest ecosystems.   In addition, we show that MODIS-PRI values, when derived from either: (i) forward views only, or (ii) Terra/Aqua same day (any view) combined observations, provided more accurate estimates of tower-measured daily LUE than those derived from either nadir or backscatter views or those calculated by the widely used semi-operational MODIS GPP model (MOD17) which is based on a theoretical maximum LUE and environmental data. Consequently, we demonstrate the importance of diurnal as well as off-nadir satellite observations for detecting vegetation physiological processes.

Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), developing countries can receive financial benefits from REDD+ activities upon the implementation of reliable measuring, verification, and reporting mechanisms. As a UN-REDD country, Tanzania has implemented the National Forestry Resources Monitoring and Assessment (NAFORMA) program as a cost-efficient solution for providing an appropriate level of precision required for sustainable forest management practices, and for international reporting on carbon pools and carbon pools change estimates at national and regional scales. The main objective of the study was to investigate various design- and model-based sampling strategies incorporating ALS measurements for estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) in miombo woodlands. The field data consisted of 65 clusters containing 513 circular NAFORMA ground plots located in Liwale District (15,867 km(2)), southeastern Tanzania, on which the aboveground tree biomass was estimated using locally developed allometric models. The ALS measurements were acquired along 32 parallel flight lines oriented in the east west direction, covering nearly 26% of Liwale District The flight lines were spaced 5 km apart and were distributed over the ground plots. Compared to the uncertainty (standard error) of the field-based estimate (4.79 Mg ha(-1)), the uncertainties of the ALS-assisted AGB estimates were consistently lower, varying from 1.73 Mg ha(-1) up to 252 Mg ha(-1) under two-stage cluster sampling, and 1.96 Mg ha(-1) for double sampling with regression estimation. Finally, strengths and shortcomings of using the NAFORMA inventory for ALS-assisted biomass estimation were discussed, underlining the implications of the field inventory design. Importantly, this study reveals the difficulty of accommodating a double sampling for stratification design, which was employed for NAFORMA, with an ALS survey having the flight lines systematically positioned over the landscape.

Over the last four decades, advances, in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types.   While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review.   This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies.   We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.

Forest assessment benefits from information about individual trees. Multibaseline SAR interferometry (InSAR) is able to generate dense point clouds of forest canopies, similar to airborne laser scanning (ALS). This type of point cloud was generated using data from the Ka-band MEMPHIS system, acquired over a mainly coniferous forest near Vordemwald in the Swiss Midlands. This point cloud was segmented using an advanced clustering technique to detect individual trees and derive their positions, heights, and crown diameters. To evaluate the InSAR point cloud properties and limitations, it was compared to products derived from ALS and stereo-photogrammetry. All point clouds showed similar geolocation accuracies with 02-0.3 m relative shifts. Both InSAR and photogrammetry techniques yielded points predominantly located in the upper levels of the forest vegetation, while ALS provided points from the top of the canopy down to the understory and forest floor. The canopy height models agreed very well with each other, with R-2 values between 0.84 and 0.89. The detected trees and their estimated physical and structural parameters were validated by comparing them to reference forestry data. A detection rate of similar to 90% was achieved for larger trees, corresponding to half of the reference trees. The smaller trees were detected with a success rate of similar to 50%. The tree height was slightly underestimated, with a R-2 value of 0.63. The estimated crown diameter agreed on an average sense, however with a relatively low R-2 value of 0.19. Very high success rates (>90%) were obtained when matching the trees detected from the InSAR-data with those detected from the ALS- and photogrammetry-data. There, InSAR tree heights were in the mean 1-1.5 m lower, with high R-2 values ranging between 0.8 and 0.9.

The numerical moment method backscattering model is used to study the sensitivity to soil roughness parameters of backscattered P-band signals. Two roughness scales related to terrain microtopography and low frequency roughness structures are considered. In the case of microtopography, the rms height is shown to be the dominant influence in the relationship between radar signals and roughness. For low frequency structures, the parameter Zs is strongly correlated with the backscattered signals. An analysis of the behavior of P-band radar signals as a function of multi-scale soil roughness (microtopography and large-scale roughness structures) reveals the complexity of using P-band data for the study of bare surface soil parameters.   The Moment method model is then compared with the real data covering a large range of microtopographic roughness values, derived from experimental airborne P-band SAR campaigns made over agricultural fields, at two sites in France. The significant discrepancies observed between measurements and simulations confirm the limitations of an analysis based on microtopographic characterizations only. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here we focus on monitoring \"within-state,\" gradual changes in vegetation in contrast with traditional monitoring of \"abrupt\" land-cover conversions. Gradual changes result from a variety of processes, such as vegetation growth and succession, damage from insects and disease, responses to shifts in climate, and other factors. Despite the prevalence of gradual changes across the landscape, they are largely ignored by the remote sensing community. Gradual changes are best characterized and monitored using time-series analysis, and with the successful launch of Landsat 8 we now have appreciable data continuity that extends the Landsat legacy across the previous 43 years. In this study, we conducted three related analyses: (1) comparison of spectral values acquired by Landsats 7 and 8, separated by eight days, to ensure compatibility for time-series evaluation; (2) tracking of multitemporal signatures for different change processes across Landsat 5, 7, and 8 sensors using anniversary-date imagery; and (3) tracking the same type of processes using all available acquisitions. In this investigation, we found that data representing natural vegetation from Landsats 5, 7, and 8 were comparable and did not indicate a need for major modification prior to use for long-term monitoring. Analyses using- anniversary-date imagery can be very effective for assessing long term patterns and trends occurring across the landscape, and are especially good for providing insights regarding trends related to long-term and continuous trends of growth or decline. We found that use of all available data provided a much more comprehensive level of understanding of the trends occurring, providing information about rate, duration, and intra- and inter-annual variability that could not be readily gleaned from the anniversary date analyses. We observed that using all available clear Landsat 5-8 observations with the new Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm was very effective for illuminating vegetation trends. There are a number of potential challenges for assessing gradual changes, including atmospheric impacts, algorithm development and visualization of the changes. One of the biggest challenges for studying gradual change will be the lack of appropriate data for validating results and products.

Data collected over an agricultural site located in Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) during the SMAP Validation Experiments 2012 (SMAPVEXI2) field campaign were used. At this site, SMOS soil moisture estimates showed a relatively good correlation for both AM and PM overpasses (R >= 0.67), but with a significant underestimation (bias approximate to -0.10 m(3)/m(3)), when compared to ground data. SMOS soil moisture data also showed a significant sensitivity to rainfall events. The DISPATCH algorithm was used to downscale bias-corrected SMOS soil moisture data over the study area for the cloud-free days during SMAPVEXI2. Compared to ground data, DISPATCH performed well, especially with the soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) linear model (R = 0.81, bias = -0.01 m(3)/m(3), RMSE = 0.05 m(3)/m(3)), which slightly outperformed the SEE non-linear model (R = 0.72, bias = -0.01 m(3)/m(3), RMSE = 0.06 m(3)/m(3)). For both models, the accuracy of the downscaling soil moisture is inversely proportional to the absolute value of soil moisture. For cloudy days, a new operational downscaling approach was proposed. It consists of combining the soil moisture simulations of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) with DISPATCH-downscaled soil moisture during cloud-free days in order to provide estimates of temporally continuous series of soil moisture at 1 km resolution. Compared to ground soil moisture data, the results indicated the high potential of our approach to retrieve soil moisture at 1 km resolution during cloudy days (R = 0.80, bias = -0.01 m(3)/m(3), RMSE = 0.07 m(3)/m(3)).

However, dedicated space-borne multispectral sensors offering radiance calibrated night lights imagery are yet to be launched. Here we examined the capabilities of Landsat 8 to acquire night time light images of the Earth. Examining seven night-time Landsat 8 scenes, we found that brightly lit areas in both urban (Berlin, Las Vegas, Nagoya and Tel-Aviv) and gas flares (Basra, Kuwait) areas were detected in all eight bands of Landsat 8. The threshold for detection of lit areas was approximately 0.4 W/m(2)/mu m/sr in bands 1-5 and 8 of Landsat 8. This threshold level was higher than Landsat dark noise levels, and slightly lower than post launch Landsat 8 OLI band dependent noise equivalent radiance difference levels. Drawing on this, we call on the USGS to plan an annual night-time acquisition of urban and gas flares areas globally, and to enable the performance of the future Landsat 10 to be established in a way that it will be sensitive enough to image the Earth at night, thus performing as Nightsat during the night.

Herein, a methodology to derive SSM estimates from space at previously unattained spatio-temporal resolutions is proposed. The method is based on a variant of the \"triangle\" inversion technique leveraging on the strengths and synergies of SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission) microwave observations and geostationary optical/infrared data. The SSM retrieval technique allows for: i) enhancing the spatial resolution of SMOS SSM product estimates to 3 km spatial resolution, and, ii) providing a temporal average daytime SM product from the instantaneous fine-scale SSM estimates acquired every 15 min; the latter is allowing higher coverage in presence of clouds and representativeness (up to 96 estimates per day) in comparison to the instantaneous estimate at the time of satellite overpass.   The proposed technique has been implemented to SMOS and MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) observations acquired over the Iberian Peninsula and Southern France during year 2011. SSM instantaneous estimates at the time of SMOS overpass and daytime-averaged SSM estimates have been obtained and evaluated separately against collocated in-situ measurements acquired from a total of 40 stations belonging to the REMEDHUS, VAS and SMOSMANIA permanent soil moisture measurement networks. Statistical agreement between compared datasets has been evaluated both at individual stations and considering the network average on the basis of several statistical terms computed including correlation, bias, root-mean-squared errors, slope and intercept of linear regression. Results showed that the proposed method not only preserves the quality of SMOS SSM at finer spatial scales, but also allows achieving higher temporal coverage and representativeness in daytime averages. The synergy of SMOS and SEVIRI provides a pathway to enhance water cycle EO capabilities taking full advantage of the new observational records of SSM and operational geostationary information.

The storm-induced half-power radio-brightness contrast (Delta I) is defined as the difference between the brightness observed at a specific wind force and that for a smooth water surface with the same physical parameters. Delta I can be related to surface wind speed and has been estimated for-300 TCs that intercept with SMOS measurements. Delta I, expressed in a common storm-centric coordinate system, shows that mean brightness contrast monotonically increases with increased storm intensity ranging from similar to 5 K for strong storms to similar to 24 K for the most intense Category 5 TCs. A remarkable feature of the 2D mean Delta I fields and their variability is that maxima are systematically found on the right quadrants of the storms in the storm-centered coordinate frame, consistent with the reported asymmetric structure of the wind and wave fields in hurricanes. These results highlight the strong potential of SMOS measurements to improve monitoring of TC intensification and evolution. An improved empirical geophysical model function (GMF) was derived using a large ensemble of co-located SMOS Delta I, aircraft and H*WIND (a multi-measurement analysis) surface wind speed data. The GMF reveals a quadratic relationship between Delta I and the surface wind speed at a height of 10 m (U-10). ECMWF and NCEP analysis products and SMOS derived wind speed estimates are compared to a large ensemble of H*WIND 2D fields. This analysis confirms that the surface wind speed in TCs can effectively be retrieved from SMOS data with an RMS error on the order of 10 kt up to 100 kt. SMOS wind speed products above hurricane force (64 kt) are found to be more accurate than those derived from NWP analyses products that systematically underestimate the surface wind speed in these extreme conditions. Using co-located estimates of rain rate, we show that the L-band radio-brightness contrasts could be weakly affected by rain or ice-phase clouds and further work is required to refine the GMF in this context.

When reducing the variance of post-stratification estimates for forest change parameters such as forest growth, it is logical to use a change-related strata map. At the stand level, a time series of Landsat images is ideally suited for producing such a map. In this study, we generate strata maps based on trajectories of Landsat Thematic Mapper-based normalized difference vegetation index values, with a focus on post-disturbance recovery and recent measurements. These trajectories, from 1985 to 2010, are converted to harmonic regression coefficient estimates and classified according to a hierarchical clustering algorithm from a training sample. The resulting strata maps are then used in conjunction with measured plots to estimate forest status and change parameters in an Alabama, USA study area. These estimates and the variance of the estimates are then used to calculate the estimated relative efficiencies of the post-stratified estimates. Estimated relative efficiencies around or above 1.2 were observed for total growth, total mortality, and total removals, with different strata maps being more effective for each. Possible avenues for improvement of the approach include the following: (1) enlarging the study area and (2) using the Landsat images closest to the time of measurement for each plot. Multitemporal satellite-derived strata maps show promise for improving the precision of change parameter estimates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

While recent climate models predict rising temperatures over East Africa throughout the 21st century, effects of land-use change on the local-scale water budget and, related therewith, on vegetation response are much more diverse. In addition, sea surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific (El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO) and Indian Ocean (Indian Ocean Dipole, IOD) are known to severely impact rainfall patterns and vegetation activity in the study area and possibly reinforce each other. Here we present long-term and seasonal vegetation dynamics derived from a GIMMS-based NDVI record resampled to 1 km spatial resolution and covering a 30-year period (1982-2011). In the long term, most of the upper mountain regions showed positive trends which was mainly attributed to vegetation recovery after disastrous fires during the outgoing 20th century. Along the western mountainside, by contrast, strong negative trends emerged as a consequence of fire-driven downward migration of Erica bush along the upper slopes and massive land conversion processes affecting the lower slopes. On the seasonal scale, a strong dependence of the regional vegetation on the effects of ENSO/IOD teleconnections became evident. Similar to previous findings on rainfall, the most beneficial effects occurred during concurrent El Nino/IOD events, while the impacts of La Nina were far less pronounced. To sum up, the newly created 1-km NDVI record proved capable of capturing long-term and seasonal vegetation patterns, which particularly applies for large-scale teleconnections, and thus provides an invaluable archive of decadal-scale vegetation dynamics in the study area.

With the analysis of remote sensing images of Zhuhai city in Southern China, this study incorporates multilevel models to estimate the hierarchical effects of landscape composition and configuration on LST. Comparisons of the single-level ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model and the multilevel models show four findings. First, LST is influenced by both level-one effects of composition (pixels) and level-two effects of configuration (groups of pixels). Second, multilevel models outperform OLS model in accounting for the LST-landscape relationships as the former produces the better fitting results and the smaller residuals and autocorrelations than the latter. Third, configuration metrics account for greater variability in LST than composition metrics. Fourth, the effects of configuration metrics vary across the level-two groups. The findings of this study provide new insights into the landscape influences on LST, and suggest that for mitigating urban heat island effects, optimizing the configurations of land cover types in urban areas should be considered because of the larger cooling effect of landscape configurations than compositions on LST.

As land surface temperature (LST) is one environmental key variable, we implemented a random forest (RF) regression approach to increase the spatial resolution of LST maps from similar to 1 km, routinely available in daily repetition from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), to similar to 250 m. LST was downscaled based on its relationship to topographic variables derived from digital elevation data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), land cover data (MODIS product MCD12Q1), and surface reflectances in the visible red and near infrared, which both are provided with the MODIS/Terra daily product MODO9GQ at similar to 250 m resolution. The approach was tested for a complex landscape in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Jordan River Region, with LST fields from aggregated Landsat-7 ETM + and MODIS (MODIS/Terra LST product MOD11A1) data; as reference at the finer scale, we used Landsat-7 derived LST data. For the ideal-case scenario with both degraded and reference values from the same sensor (Landsat-7 ETM +), root mean square errors (RMSE) of downscaled LSTs ranged from 1.02 K to 1.43 K for six different acquisition dates. When compared to the widely-adopted and in parallel applied TsHARP sharpening method, that is based on the relationship between NDVI and LST, downscaling accuracy with RF improved up to 19%. Applying the RF approach to MODIS LST products yielded RMSEs from 1.41 K to 1.92 K, whereas the TsHARP method and also a uniform disaggregation by resampling provided only slightly worse results. For the real MODIS LST product, downscaling with RF was affected by lower thermal contrasts in the image data that hindered an adequate training to reproduce temperature variations at the finer scale of similar to 250 m. In this context, we assume the LST product of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument (as a successor of MODIS onboard the SUOMI NPP platform) to be a better candidate for downscaling, as it provides a spatial resolution of similar to 750 m. One advantage of the RF approach is that predictor datasets can easily be adapted to data availability. In an extended RF approach with all Landsat spectral bands, downscaling results for formerly aggregated Landsat data improved distinctly and now ranged from 0.98 K to 1.33 K. This approach is also promising for the downscaling of real MODIS or VIIRS LST data as it may be combined with already available reflective data fusion models that are able to blend Landsat data and sensor data with a coarse spatial resolution (given spectral bandwidths corresponding to Landsat) to generate temporally dense synthetic Landsat time series.

Thinning of an ice shelf reduces its ability to restrain the ice discharge from the grounded ice sheet. However, our understanding of how ice shelf processes couple ice-sheet changes to climate variability is still rudimentary. In part, this is due to the brevity and low temporal resolution of surveys of ice shelf thickness relative to the broad range of time scales on which ice-sheet mass fluctuates. Here, we present improved procedures to construct 18-year (1994-2012) time series of Antarctic ice shelf surface height at high spatial resolution (similar to 30 km) by merging data from three overlapping satellite radar altimeter missions (ERS-1, ERS-2, and Envisat). We apply an averaging scheme to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of height changes over the floating ice shelves, and extract low-order polynomial trends using a robust approach (regularized regression with cross-validation) that accounts for both bias and variance in the fit. We construct formal confidence intervals by bootstrap resampling of the residuals of the fit. The largest source of height error arises from the interaction of the radar signal with the snow and firn surface; on annual time scales, changes in surface and sub-surface scattering and radar penetration lead to apparent height changes that are larger than the true surface-height change arising from densification. Our 18-year time series of surface height provide an insight into how ice shelves respond to the changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Our methods could also be applied to grounded portions of the ice sheets, both in Antarctica and Greenland.

For the three inversion configurations, the NNs were trained and validated using a noisy synthetic dataset generated by the WCM for a wide range of soil moisture and vegetation descriptor values. The trained NNs were then validated from a real dataset composed of X-band SAR backscattering coefficients and vegetation descriptor derived from optical images. The use of X-band SAR measurements in HH polarization (in addition to one vegetation descriptor derived from optical images) yields more precise results on soil moisture (My) estimates. In the case of NDVI derived from optical images as the vegetation descriptor, the Root Mean Square Error on My estimates was 3.6 Vol.% for NDVI values between 0.45 and 0.75, and 6.1 Vol.% for NDVI between 0.75 and 0.90. Similar results were obtained regardless of the other vegetation descriptor used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Fine resolution albedo retrievals enable quantifying the relationships between forest variables and albedo also in patchy landscapes, such as in the managed forests in Fennoscandia. In this study, field plot data, airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and high resolution satellite albedo retrievals from Landsat were used to investigate the main factors influencing forest albedo in Central Finland in midsummer. Tree species, forest structure and under story (ground) vegetation composition all influenced forest albedo. The tree species-specific models were estimated on a subpixel scale by utilizing information on the proportions of each species within a plot. Tree species considerably improved the albedo prediction when added to a model containing only a structural variable, whereas a further addition of the site fertility class as a proxy of understory vegetation composition only slightly improved the model. Albedo decreased with increasing volume of growing stock, but the decrease leveled off at high volumes. The albedo of plots with high volume was instead mainly governed by tree species and was the lowest for Norway spruce, intermediate for Scots pine and highest for broadleaved species. Norway spruce albedo decreased almost linearly with increasing mean tree height. ALS-derived canopy cover explained fairly well the variation in albedo in the visible region, but the total shortwave albedo was better predicted by ALS-derived tree height. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Tools that can characterize their distributions along with other features important as wildlife habitat, such as woody shrub cover, would be useful for research and management purposes. Three dimensional lidar data and Landsat time series disturbance products have both shown varying promise in their ability to characterize aspects of dead biomass and understory cover, but studies exploring the combination of the remote sensing datasets calibrated with field data to model difficult to map habitat components are limited. The purpose of this study was to 1) relate lidar and Landsat time series products to field collected calibration data to produce maps of important post-fire wildlife habitat components including snags of varying sizes and the availability of a woody shrub layer; and 2) compare the individual performance of the Landsat and lidar datasets for predicting the distributions of these difficult to map forest habitat features Using 164 field calibration plots and remote sensing predictors, we modeled and mapped the distributions of our response variables including snag classes (dbh >= 40 cm; >= 50 cm, and >= 75 cm) and woody shrub cover thresholds (>= 30 and >= 50% cover) at 10 m resolutions. Remote sensing predictors included various lidar structure and topography variables and Landsat time series products representing the pre-fire forest, disturbance magnitude, and current forest condition. A model was chosen for mapping purposes using AIC model selection and then by comparing leave-one-out-cross-validation error matrices to choose among competing models. We were able to predict and map all response variables with moderate accuracies and variable sensitivity (true positive) and specificity (true negative) rates. All snag and shrub models were considered to have \"good\" predictive performance as indicated by area under the curve values (0.74-0.91), with percent correctly classified values ranging from 69-85% when a probability threshold is chosen that balances false positive and false negative errors. Landsat models performed marginally better than lidar structure models according to classification statistics. Landsat-only models had slightly less accuracy than models that included lidar and Landsat data, but often with greater errors than the combined model. The ability to map the response variables with moderate errors and acceptable accuracies for many applications was through the fusion of these remote sensing datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The first is of interest due to its dominant influence on inter-annual variability, while the second may reveal lower frequency variability or trends. Precipitation products used for this study included gridded rainfall estimates derived by interpolation of rain gauge data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), two satellite remote sensing products (CHIRP and TRMM TMPA version 7), and two weather forecast model re-analysis products (ERA-Interim and MERRA). The products covered the period 1981-2014 except TMPA (1998-2014). Statistical and frequency-based inter-comparisons were performed to evaluate the seasonal and long-term skills of various rainfall products against the BoM product. The results indicate that linear trends in rainfall during 1981-2014 were largely attributable to ENSO and IOD. Both intra-annual and seasonal rainfall changes associated with ENSO and IOD increased from 1991 to 2014. Among the continent\'s 13 major river basins, the greatest precipitation variations associated with ENSO/IOD were found over the Northern and North East Coast, while the smallest contributions were for Tasmania and the South West Coast basins. We also found that although the assessed products show comparable spatial variability of rainfall over Australia, systematic seasonal differences exist that were more pronounced during the ENSO and IOD events.

To relieve these difficulties, this study employs multi-temporal and multi-sensor fusion methods for a long-term and fine-scale summer SUHI analysis of the city of Wuhan in China. By integrating several series of satellite images, we generated 26-year (1988 to 2013) high spatial resolution (Landsat-like) summer land surface temperature (LST) data. This series of data was then used for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the SUHI patterns, evolution characteristics, and mechanisms. This study not only provides a generalized research framework for the long-term and fine-scale analysis of the SUHI effect, but also reveals several findings about the heat distribution and SUHI characteristics in Wuhan. Firstly, our results show that the high temperature and sub-high temperature areas were continuously concentrated from rural to urban areas, but the high temperature area within the old city zones showed an obvious decreasing tendency. Secondly, a more important finding is that the SUHI intensity first increased and then decreased over the 26 years. The maximum temperature difference between the city zone and the rural area was in 2003 (7.19 K for the old city zone, and 4.65 K for the area within the third ring road). Finally, we confirm that the relationships between heat distribution and land cover (especially vegetation and impervious surfaces) were interannually stable, and that the influences of industry, businesses, and residential districts on the SUHI effect were in descending order in Wuhan.

Results demonstrate that, while considerable spatial error auto-correlation exists in the errors for all three products, the inclusion of this information into a 2D assimilation system does not significantly improve the performance of the system relative to a one-dimensional (1D) baseline. This result is explained via an analytical evaluation of the impact of spatial error auto-correlation on the steady-state Kalman gain, which reveals that 2D filtering requires the existence of large auto-correlation differences (between the assimilation model and the assimilated observations) in order to enhance the analysis relative to a 1D filtering baseline. As a result, large error auto-correlations alone (in both the model or observations) are not sufficient to motivate the application of a 2D land assimilation system. These results have important consequences for the development of land data assimilation systems designed to ingest satellite derived surface soil moisture products for water resource and climate applications.

Here the error assessment problem is solved through Pythagorean constraints in Hilbert space, which is slightly different from the original inner product solution but allows us to define a unique solution to the multiple collocation. The Pythagorean solution is fully equivalent to the original inner product solution for the triple collocation case. The multiple collocation turns out to be an over-constrained problem and a least squares solution is presented. As the most critical assumption of uncorrelated errors will surely fail in most multiple collocation problems, we propose to divide the source estimates into structural groups based on their production process and treat the structural and non-structural errors separately. Such error separation allows the source estimates to have their structural errors fully correlated within the same structural group, which is much more realistic than the original assumption. A new error assessment procedure is developed which performs the collocation twice, each for one type of errors (structural and non-structural), and then sums up the two types of errors. The new procedure is also fully backward compatible with the original triple collocation technique. Error assessment experiments are carried out for surface soil moisture data from multiple remote sensing models, land surface models, and in situ measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have demonstrated the sensitivity to fire effects of L-band SAR sensors using post-fire datasets and empirical modeling. This study proposed an innovative method for estimating fire severity by combining pre- and post-fire SAR datasets within a change detection framework to compute a novel index, the Radar Bum Ratio (RBR). More importantly, a standardized RBR was developed and tested over seven temperate forest types located on three continents with above ground biomass values ranging from 30 to over 500 t ha(-1). RBR standardization allowed for common thresholds to be defined and subsequently used for estimating the Composite Burn Index (CBI, a measure of fire impact) without the need for a priori information (i.e., in situ data) on local post-fire conditions. The estimation accuracy of the standardized RBR was compared to locally-calibrated empirical models based on field CBI data. The results showed similar estimation errors and a strong agreement with the reference in situ data (i.e., Cohen\'s weighted kappa >0.61). The RBR index most sensitive to fire severity was based on the cross-polarized channel applied under dry environmental conditions. Under wet conditions the estimation accuracy was considerably lower. The methods proposed in this study are particularly valuable for rapid fire severity assessments at regional to global scales, requiring only that RBR thresholds be calibrated for a range of environments and that CBI scores be related to fuel consumption for each forest type.

The expressed precipitation gradient from the wet Caribbean side to the dry Pacific side makes Panama an excellent study area for performing a mesoscale assessment of climate effects on tropical tree species richness. Spatial patterns in local spectral variability (expressed as the coefficient of variation) and spectral similarity (expressed as the spectral similarity index) were used as proxies for species area curves and species distance decay curves. Our analysis revealed significant spectral changes along the precipitation gradient. Highest spectral diversity was observed for moist forest sites while lowest diversity was observed for the driest forest sites. Most of the spectral variation came from changes in the visible (VIS) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) reflectance. Variation in the VIS was significantly higher for the dry compared to the moist and wet forests, while the opposite was true for the NIR and SWIR reflectance. Our spectral mesoscale analysis extends previous results suggesting that niche differentiation with respect to soil water availability is a direct determinant of both local- and regional-scale distributions of tropical trees. A next step would be to test the accuracy and scalability of our results with lower spatial resolution spectrometer data, simulating the observing conditions that will be achieved with future satellite missions such as the European Union\'s EnMap and NASA\'s HyspIRI missions.

These ecotones between aquatic and terrestrial environments also provide protection from storm damage, run-off filtering, and recharge of aquifers. Many wetlands along coasts have been exposed to stress-inducing alterations globally, including dredge and fill operations, hydrologic modifications, pollutants, impoundments, fragmentation by roads/ditches, and sea level rise. For wetland protection and sensible coastal development, there is a need to monitor these ecosystems at global and regional scales. Recent advances in satellite sensor design and data analysis are providing practical methods for monitoring natural and man-made changes in wetlands. However, available satellite remote sensors have been limited to mapping primarily wetland location and extent. This paper describes how the HyspIRI hyperspectral and thermal infrared sensors can be used to study and map key ecological properties, such as species composition, biomass, hydrology, and evapotranspiration of tidal salt and brackish marshes and mangroves, and perhaps other major wetland types, including freshwater marshes and wooded/shrub wetlands.

The main features of the proposed algorithm, which is based on the inversion of a radiative transfer model, are: i) a higher spatial resolution (250 m) with respect to the corresponding standard MODIS product and ii) tuning the model to the spectral characteristics of mountain grasslands.   To quantify the effects of the features of the proposed algorithm, the approach is first applied to a MODIS reflectance data time series from 2007 up-scaled to a 1 km spatial resolution for better comparison with the standard MODIS LAI product. In the next step, the benefit of the higher spatial resolution is assessed by applying the algorithm to a series of MODIS satellite images with a spatial resolution of 250 m acquired over the central Alps in the period 2005-2007. LAI estimates were validated for both temporal consistency and accuracy using ground measurement time series collected at three different study sites in the investigated area. The results obtained demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm to follow the expected temporal and range dynamics of LAI in this challenging environment, showing an overall RMSE accuracy of 1.68 (m(2)/m(2)). This approach thus opens a promising avenue for the exploitation of moderate resolution satellite data for novel and more accurate monitoring studies at a regional scale in mountain environments.

This is particularly noticeable in the Pacific Northwest and coastal areas, yet has been less obvious in locations farther inland. Using the historical Landsat image archive, snow cover was mapped in the Wind River Range (WRR) in northwestern Wyoming, from 1972-2013. The objective of this work was to estimate the temporal change in the rate of snowmelt in the Fremont Lake basin of the WRR for the 42-year study period. Much of the streamflow in Wyoming originates from melting snow in the WRR. Streamflow is a significant contributor to the water resources for the north-central part of the state and has tremendous societal and economic impacts especially during the prolonged drought that is affecting the western U.S. Consistent with the ongoing and severe drought, data from the Pine Creek Above Fremont Lake gauge show a striking reduction in cumulative stream discharge in the 2000s vs. the decades of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Snow-cover depletion curves derived from snow maps created from Landsat imagery were generated for the period 1972-2013. MODerate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived standard snow-cover maps were also used to generate snow-cover depletion curves, from 2000-2013, to provide an accuracy assessment of the Landsat technique. Landsat-derived mean snow-cover depletion curves from 2000-2013 and from the three previous decades, show that snow cover in the Fremont lake basin is melting 16 +/- 10 days earlier, on average, in the 2000s compared to the period from 1972-1999. Increasing spring and summer nighttime air temperature is the likely driver of the earlier snowmelt documented in the Landsat record.

This study provides an observation-based multiyear estimate of trans-Atlantic dust transport using a 7-year (2007-2013) record of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) measurements of the three dimensional distribution of aerosol backscatter, extinction and depolarization ratio in both cloud-free and above-cloud conditions. We estimate that on a basis of the 7-year average and integration over 10 degrees S-30 degrees N, 182 Tg a(-1) dust leaves the coast of North Africa at 15 degrees W, of which 132 Tg a(-1) and 43 Tg a(-1) reaches 35 degrees W and 75 degrees W, respectively. These flux estimates have an overall known uncertainty of (45-70)%. Because of lack of reliable observations, uncertainties associated with the diurnal variation of dust and the missing below-cloud dust cannot be quantified. Significant seasonal variations are observed in both the magnitude of total dust mass flux and its meridional and vertical distributions. The interannual variability of annual dust mass flux is highly anti-correlated with the prior-year Sahel Precipitation Index. Using only cloud-free aerosol observations to calculate dust mass flux could introduce a high bias when compared with all-sky conditions that include both cloud-free and above-cloud aerosol observations. The bias is about 20% at 35 degrees W and 75 degrees W in boreal winter and spring based on the 7-year average, as long as dust within and below low-level clouds is negligible.

This study evaluated the spatial scaling of albedo and related reflectance-based quantities over areas of high spatial heterogeneity in temperate mixed forest, deciduous forest, urban and built-up, and cropland/natural mosaic lands under snow covered conditions. Reflectance-based quantities evaluated included spectral radiance, surface directional reflectance, and spectral and broadband albedo derived from ground- and tower-based measurements and high-resolution (5 m) hyperspectral imagery (HSI) to coarse resolution (similar to 500 m) MODIS satellite data.   Our approach first compared ground- and tower-based spectral and broadband reflectance quantities to HSI data, then to evaluate HSI with MODIS reflectance-based products. Over snow-covered pasture, HSI directional reflectance was biased lower than ground-based measurements collected using a spectroradiometer, and greatly underestimated at wavelengths less than 450 nm. Tower-based shortwave broadband albedo (280-2800 nm) and HSI albedo agreed within +/- 0.04. HSI directional spectral reflectance agreed well with tower-based measurements of spectral albedo collected using a spectroradiometer and remote cosine receptor above a mixed forest canopy with underlying snow cover. Spectral albedo collected over a dormant deciduous broadleaf canopy increased from 0.10 for snow-free conditions to 0.14-0.18 when snow-cover was present under the canopy. Canopy shortwave broadband albedo was not very sensitive to underlying snowpack depth, indicative of strong vegetation masking.   Next, HSI data were spatially aggregated and averaged to 500 m MODIS grids and compared to two MODIS albedo products: (1) MODIS/Terra and Aqua Combined Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) Albedo V005 (MCD43A, magnitude inversion), and (2) MODIS/Ferra Snow Cover Daily 13 Global 500 m Grid (MOD10A1). An assessment of surface heterogeneity demonstrated that MODIS products generally perform well for snow-covered landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity, with biases between +/- 0.04 and RMSEs less than 0.085 for mixed and deciduous broadleaf forested and urban & built-up land cover classes, and less than 0.11 for cropland/natural mosaic. Biases were generally lower for MOD10A1 compared to MCD43A3.   Mean shortwave broadband albedo from MODIS and HSI over deciduous broadleaf and mixed forest with underlying snow cover ranged from 0.14 to 028. Albedo over MODIS grids characterized as a mosaic of cropland, forests, grasslands, and shrublands (e.g., cropland/natural mosaic) was substantially higher than forested grids under snow-covered conditions, ranging from 039 to 0.43.

The MCC calculation is validated in a series of Bio-Optical Forecasting (BioCast) experiments with predetermined synthetic velocities, and its products are evaluated by examining the errors and biases with respect to the High Frequency Radar (HFRadar) measurements. The root-mean-square (RMS) errors in our best current products derived from the overlap of satellite sensor swath between the VIIRS sequential orbits are less than 0.17 m s(-1) in the evaluation area outside of the Chesapeake Bay. The most accurate current products are those derived from the imagery data of R-rs(551), B-b(551) and C(551), while the image sequences of B-b(551) and Z(eu)_lee are identified as the most suited products for the retrieval of currents because of their best production capacities of valid velocity vectors. Mechanisms between the advective processes and the dynamic changes of bio-optical properties are discussed regarding the performances of various color products on the retrieval of currents. Similarities of velocity distribution in the retrieved vector arrays are collected across different MCC products derived from ocean color datasets that are of different types and derived from different spectral channels of satellite overpasses. The inter-product similarities themselves can be used to characterize the near-surface advection as well and usually have smaller errors than each of the individual MCC currents. Moreover, efforts are also under way to improve the ocean color derived currents by merging several of the MCC products with similarities to increase the total spatial coverage. This study not only seeks the image-derived products best representing the sea surface current structures in coastal areas, but also exploits how these currents can be improved or optimized to support the ocean forecasts.

Various remote sensing approaches have assessed the impacts of beetle outbreaks over the last two decades. However, few studies have addressed the impacts of historical mountain pine beetle outbreaks, including the 1970s event that impacted Glacier National Park. The lack of spatially explicit data on this disturbance represents both a major data gap and a critical research challenge in that wildfire has removed some of the evidence from the landscape. We utilized multiple lines of evidence to model forest canopy mortality as a proxy for outbreak severity. We incorporate historical aerial and landscape photos, aerial detection survey data, a nine-year collection of satellite imagery and abiotic data. This study presents a remote sensing based framework to (1) relate measurements of canopy mortality from fine-scale aerial photography to coarse-scale multispectral imagery and (2) classify the severity of mountain pine beetle affected areas using a temporal sequence of Landsat data and other landscape variables. We sampled canopy mortality in 261 plots from aerial photos and found that insect effects on mortality were evident in changes to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over time. We tested multiple spectral indices and found that a combination of NDVI and the green band resulted in the strongest model. We report a two-step process where we utilize a generalized least squares model to account for the large-scale variability in the data and a binary regression tree to describe the small-scale variability. The final model had a root mean square error estimate of 9.8% canopy mortality, a mean absolute error of 7.6% and an R-2 of 0.82. The results demonstrate that a model of percent canopy mortality as a continuous variable can be developed to identity a gradient of mountain pine beetle severity on the landscape.

Using six time series PALSAR mosaics, the characteristics of HH and HV gamma nought (gamma(0)) in natural forests and deforested areas from 2007 to 2010 and the accuracy of deforestation detection by using a threshold were investigated. We obtained the following results: (1) Applying a simple thresholding method to time series differences of gamma(0)(HV) was effective for fully automatic detection of deforestation areas. When we used a fixed threshold, the accuracy ranged from 72% to 96% (average of 87%). (2) gamma(0)(HH) did not always show systematic changes after deforestation. (3) The temporal variation of gamma(0) for deforested areas was larger than that for natural forests. These variations in gamma(0) were correlated with 10-day accumulated precipitation. High accumulated precipitation decreased the gamma(0) difference between deforested areas and natural forests, causing decreased accuracy of deforestation detection. (4) Integration of the results from two different dates in a given year can reduce the detection error due to time variations and provide highly accurate results (average accuracy of 91%, minimum of 82%). The accuracy values quoted except hilly areas, shadow, and lay-over. The proposed method is effective for detection of deforestation larger than 1 ha. The deforestation mapping method proposed in the study can be utilized for assessment of yearly changes in forested areas and is useful for tracking changes in forest cover on large scales.

These time-lag constellations were for the most part not even meant to exhibit motion tracking capabilities, or these capabilities were considered a drawback In this contribution, we give the first systematic overview of the methods and issues involved in exploiting near-simultaneous airborne and satellite acquisitions. We first cover the category of the near-simultaneous acquisitions produced by individual stereo sensors, typically designed for topographic mapping, with a time-lag on the order of a minute. Over this time period, we demonstrate that the movement of river ice debris, sea ice floes or suspended sediments can be tracked, and we estimate the corresponding water surface velocity fields. Similarly, we assess cloud motion vector fields and vehicle trajectories. A second category of near-simultaneous acquisitions, with much smaller time-lags of at most a few seconds, is associated with along-track offsets of detector lines in the focal plane of pushbroom systems. These constellations are demonstrated here to be suitable to detect motion of fast vehicles, such as cars and airplanes, or, for instance, ocean waves. Acquisition delays are, third, also produced by other constellations such as \'trains\' of satellites following each other and leading to time-lags of minutes to tens of minutes, which are in this contribution used to track icebergs and features of floating ice crystals on the sea, and an algae bloom. For all acquisition categories, the higher the spatial resolution of the data and the longer the time-lag, the smaller the minimum speed that can be detected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The model enhances PM2.5 estimation accuracy by considering spatial variation and nonstationarity that might introduce significant biases into PM2.5 estimation. The model was evaluated and validated against the PM2.5 data collected over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China for the period of May 2012 to September 2013. The evaluation evidenced that, with meteorological parameters assimilated, the GWR model is able to explain 73.8% of the variability in ground-level PM2.5 concentration, a better performance than the two conventional statistical models (a general linear regression model Model-I, 56.4% and a semi-empirical model Model-II, 52.6%, respectively). The vertical correction on satellite-derived AOD and relative humidity significantly improve the AOD-PM2.5 correlative relationship.

The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on board ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) provided three-dimensional observations that can be used to derive these canopy structure parameters globally. While several canopy height products have been produced globally from GLAS, no comparable data sets for LAI and canopy profiles exist across large areas. In this study we develop a physically based method of retrieving LAI and vertical foliage profiles (VFPs) from GLAS observations over the entire state of California, USA. This method refines lidar derived LAI and VFP through a recursive analysis of GLAS waveforms using ancillary data obtained from existing remote sensing products. Those supplemental inputs include canopy clumping index derived from POLDER, 500 m land cover type and 1 km LAI data derived from MODIS. Implementation of our method created state-level LAI and VFP data for the existing GIAS transects over California. We then analyzed the variability of LAI and VFP data sets across environmental gradients and as a function of land cover type and elevation. Both LAI and VFP showed strong variability across elevational gradients and among land cover types. We compared our results at the scale of GLAS footprints with an LAI map derived from Landsat (at 30 m) and found moderate agreement (r(2) = 034, bias = 0.26, RMSD (Root Mean Square Difference) = 1.85) between the two. In particular, Landsat LAI not only appeared to saturate relative to GLAS LAI at around LAI = 5, but also showed an overestimation for LAI less than about 2. Best agreement between the two LAI data sets was shown to occur in areas with slope less than 20 degrees. Results from our study suggest the possibility of retrieving global LAI and VFP data from GIAS data and the potential for synergetic observation of lidar and passive optical remote sensing data such as Landsat.

Wind speed and direction from these products were compared to measurements collected at five buoys moored along the Iberian Peninsula Atlantic coast.   Results show that WRF modelled offshore winds are the best alternative to in situ measured offshore wind data, showing the highest temporal accuracy (the ability in representing the wind speed and direction at a given time instant) and lowest errors in terms of offshore wind power flux estimations. However, offshore wind data taken from CCMP shows the lowest errors in terms of the mean wind speeds and, together with IFREMER-BWF, the best wind temporal accuracy after WRF simulation. Therefore, in general CCMP and IFREMER-BWF can be considered as the best alternatives to WRF high resolution modelled offshore winds, if the latter is not available. Specifically for offshore wind energy resource assessment, NCEP-CFSR reanalysis or NCEP-GFS analysis data can also be used with confidence as an alternative to WRF modelled data, showing better wind power flux estimates than CCMP and IFREMER-BWF.   Despite the best performances of WRF high resolution offshore winds, such modelling tasks require considerable computational resources and time to obtain quality results. Therefore, the value of satellite-derived wind data should not be disregarded. These remotely sensed offshore wind measurements should be seriously considered when searching for alternative sources of wind information for ocean areas, in particular for open ocean areas where they have their strength.

The spatial and temporal variations of the annual ARE are calculated based on satellite and ground-based measurements, supplemented by radiative transfer simulations. During 2001-2010, our results indicate that the TOA diurnally averaged ARE is -5.6 +/- 0.8 Wm(-2) over land and -4.8 +/- 0.7 Wm(-2) over ocean, respectively. In contrast, the surface ARE is -13.8 +/- 3.2 Wm(-2) based on radiative transfer calculations. For aerosol layers of 2 km in height with midvisible optical depth of 1.41 and single scattering albedo of 0.91, the shortwave radiative heating can exceed 0.8 K/day. Our results indicate significant inter-annual variability of aerosol radiative properties, which is extremely large over major emission outflow regions like SEAS.

To demonstrate the characteristics of the data over this test site, time series of monthly mean ocean brightness temperatures are constructed separately for the ascending and descending passes. These time series provide a useful pattern of annual variation of the AMSU-A measurements for inter-calibration of microwave radiometers onboard multiple satellites to estimate the Intersatellite/intersensor Calibration Biases (ICBs) at individual channels. Differences (Delta T = T-N18 - T-N19) of monthly mean brightness temperatures (as denoted by T-N18 and TN19, respectively) between the NOAA-18 and NOAA-19 near-nadir measurements are used to estimate the ICBs at individual channels. It is found that the AT values distribute around individual ICBs with near zero slopes, except channel 8 which shows a noticeable anomalous trend in the AT time series. This abnormal behavior coincides with the degradation of the NOAA-19 noise equivalent delta temperatures (NE Delta Ts) which have greatly exceeded the AMSU-A specification since early 2010. This instrument problem is clearly detected in this study. Diurnal variations of the time series of data were corrected with a diurnal cycle of the measurements, which are modeled with a second-order Fourier series, from four AMSU-A radiometers onboard NOAA-15, -16, -18 and METOP-A, respectively. These four satellites have different local equator crossing times across the diurnal period. The results presented in this study will be useful for data users to have a better understanding of the measurements before using these AMSU-A data for weather forecasting or to create data sets for climate applications.

This paper presents a new surface solar irradiance dataset, the broadband (0.2-4 mu m) surface solar irradiance product derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The OMI SSI algorithm is based on the Heliosat method and uses the OMI O-2-O-2 cloud product as main input. The OMI SSI data are validated against the globally distributed Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) measurements at 19 stations for the year 2008. Furthermore, the monthly mean OMI SSI data are compared to independent surface solar irradiance products from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Flux Data (ISCCP-FD) and Clouds and the Earth\'s Radiant Energy System (CERES) data for the year 2005. The mean difference between OMI SSI and BSRN global (direct + diffuse) irradiances is - 1.2W m(-2) (-0.2%), the root mean square error is 100.1 W m(-2) (18.1%), and the mean absolute error is 67.8W m(-2) (12.2%). The differences between OMI SSI and BSRN global irradiances are smaller over continental and coastal sites and larger over deserts and islands. OMI SSI has a good agreement with the CERES shortwave (SW) model B surface downward flux (SDF) product. The correlation coefficient and index of agreement between monthly mean 1-degree gridded OMI SSI and CERES SW SDF are >0.99. OMI SSI is lower than CERES SW SDF which is partly due to the solar zenith angle. On average, OMI SSI is 13.5 W m(-2) (2.5%) lower than the ISCCPFD SW surface downward flux and the correlation coefficient and index of agreement are >0.98 for every month. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The dependency of forest albedo on stand age was estimated from MODIS albedo retrievals using a linear unmixing approach combined with nonlinear regression. Exponential function was appropriate to describe the decline of coniferous forest albedo with stand age in all seasons and the decline of deciduous broadleaved albedo in winter. The effect of stand age on albedo was stronger for spruce than for pine, and the variation in albedo as a function of stand age was larger in winter than in summer for all species and wavelength regions. When applied to the test data, the albedo values predicted using the estimated age dependent albedo functions produced somewhat better results than when using only the species specific mean albedos as predictors. The tendency of the albedo values predicted using the age dependent functions towards the mean of the observed values suggested that the models did not cover all variation in the species specific forest albedos. A larger variation in the predicted albedos was obtained when age dependent albedo functions were estimated using Landsat albedo estimates.

The collections include imagery acquired over six fixed locations in the Arctic Basin since 1999. Targeted acquisitions over drifting ice parcels, from 2009 on, provide an added dimension to the LIDP archive. This mode of acquisition is especially useful for capturing time-varying processes during the melt season. In this paper, we describe the characteristics of LIDPs, the extent of the current archive, and highlight their uses for Arctic sea ice science. At this writing, the archive of LIDPs is still quite limited, and thus this paper illustrates the potential utility of the imagery. We provide an overview of the retrieval of five sea ice parameters that would benefit significantly from the surface details afforded by the higher resolution LIDPs. They include: melt pond coverage, open water fraction, ridge height, floe size, and, openings and closings. Two other uses are suggested: measurement of lateral melt and the interpretation of radar backscatter. The intent is to motivate geophysical uses of the LIDP and future acquisitions. Results here suggest that the effective observations of sea ice parameters and especially their changes require more focused sampling strategies to address specific spatial and temporal sampling needs. Presently, acquisitions of this type of imagery at fixed locations and drifting sites are being continued, and LIDPs are added to the archive as they are released.

In this case, polygons can be selected as sampling units to match the conceptual model of the map. However, little attention has been paid to the use of polygons for the validation of those maps. In this paper, we quantitatively assess the prediction of the primary thematic accuracy indices when the sampling unit is a polygon. The variable size of the sample polygons is a major concern for the prediction of the accuracy indices. Indeed, the classification accuracy, in addition to being class-dependent, depends on the polygon area. A practical solution supported by a theoretical framework that is conditional to the sample dataset is proposed in this study. This new predictor takes advantage of the known classification results for an improved efficiency. Empirical results based on synthetic maps show that the new predictor outperforms alternative methods for overall accuracy. The RMSE of the area weighted predictor was achieved with 50% less sample polygons thanks to our new predictor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the Interactions between Soil Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) LSM is coupled to the Community Microwave Emission Modelling platform (CMEM). Simulations of Tb are performed over a 3-yr period (2003-2005) for a bare soil field in southwestern France, at the Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir EXperiment (SMOSREX) experimental site. Both ISBA and CMEM present several options for the representation of the soil moisture and soil temperature profiles. Simplified 2-layer simulations are compared with more detailed multilayer simulations. In the 2-layer simulations, the soil is divided into two layers (a thin surface layer and a bulk reservoir), and Fresnel laws are used in CMEM to model the smooth surface emissivity. In the multilayer simulations, the ISBA soil diffusion scheme is used (with 11 soil layers represented) together with either the Wilheit or Fresnel option of CMEM. The Tb simulations are compared to the Tb ground observations available for the SMOSREX site, at H and V polarizations and at different angles, and the impact of soil roughness is assessed. It is shown that taking surface soil moisture into account in the calculation of soil roughness improves the representation of the seasonal cycle and increases the correlation for all the versions of CMEM. The Tb derived from the most complex multilayer simulations correlate slightly better to the observations than the Tb derived from the 2-layer model (r = 0.84 and r = 0.82, respectively, for the pooled dataset). This is partly due to a better representation of the soil moisture profile. Finally, the multilayer model is used to investigate the L-band sampling depth for contrasting soil texture profiles. For a variety of soil textures, it is found that Tb are mainly driven by the top 15 cm soil layer.

We have investigated the interannual variability of the spatially averaged vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) in response to atmospheric forcing and river discharge. Our results indicate that atmospheric forcing does not have a significant influence on interannual anomalies of K-d(490) in the Baltic Sea. This is dissimilar to the North Atlantic at the same latitudes, where interannual variability of phytoplankton blooms (ocean color chlorophyll concentration, Chl,and K-d) is to a large degree controlled by local weather. In contrast, in the Baltic Sea the interannual variability of K-d(490) is significantly influenced by river runoff. Higher values of K-d(490) are observed in years with larger inflow of water from rivers. Without access to more detailed information about the concentrations of various optically significant water components we can only speculate about the possible reasons for this relationship. Most likely a combination of several factors causes the observed positive correlation between K-d(490) and river discharge. These factors include development of more intense phytoplankton blooms in response to a larger supply of nutrients delivered by rivers. This conclusion is supported by satellite Chl data. However, an advection of optically important material with river water most likely also contributes to the bserved variability of K-d(490). The diffuse attenuation coefficient plays a critical role in many oceanographic processes. For example, K-d is essential for quantification of radiative heating of the ocean, in models of primary production and other photoprocesses, and in studies discussing water turbidity and water quality. Better understanding of the variability of K-d in the Baltic Sea can improve our knowledge of this marine environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This study used the 500-m MODIS surface reflectance products (MOD09A1) from 2000 to 2009 to extract NDVI time series of C-3 and C-4 grass PFTs in different floristic regions (tallgrass, shortgrass, and mixed-grass prairies.) A set of phenology metrics, including Start of Season, End of Season, Season Length, Peak NDVI, Peak Date, and END VI, were found useful in delineating these grass types. A phenology-assisted decision tree classifier was developed to map the four grass PFTs in the Great Plains. The relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 PFTs generally showed the expected latitudinal shifts. Longitudinal shifts of tallgrass and shortgrass PFTs were also in agreement with the distributions of floristic prairie regions. In shortgrass and northern mixed prairies, shortgrass C-3 was located in the north while shortgrass C-4 was in the south. The native tallgrass C-4 remained in prairie remnants, although other native grasslands had been mostly converted to croplands or tallgrass C-3-dominated pastures. The interannual spatial variations of PFTs were statistically correlated with climate factors over a 10-year study period. The preliminary findings revealed that the strength and direction of correlations varied geographically and seasonally for different PFTs. This spatio-temporally explicit information may provide quantitative inputs in ecological forecasting for various climate change scenarios.

An adaptive model was developed based on the merits of coupling a genetic algorithm to select spectral variables and partial least squares (GA-PLS) for regression. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to evaluate the GA-PLS model performance using datasets collected from 1140 stations encompassing a wide range of Chl-a and suspended sediment from nine water bodies across Central Indiana (CIN), USA, South Australia (SA), Taihu Lake (THL) in East China and Shitoukoumen Reservoir (STKR) in Northeast China with comparison to a widely accepted three-band model, and (2) to evaluate the GA-PLS spatial transferability with simulated ESA/Sentinel3/OLCI and Hyperion spectra. The GA-PLS and the three-band model yield accurate calibrations (Cal) for the SA dataset with R-2 above 0.98, and the corresponding validation (Val) shows relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) of less than 6.2% with narrow-band spectra. Both the GA-PLS and three-band model show stable performance for the CIN dataset (Cal: R-2 = 0.91 and 0.77; Val: rRMSE = 20.1% and 33.4%), THL dataset (Cal: R-2 = 0.91 and 0.88; Val: rRMSE = 30.1% and 33.7%), and STKR dataset (R-2 = 0.84 and 0.82; rRMSE = 29.1% and 33.2%). The results also reveal that simulated OLCI datasets degrade both the GA-PLS performance, and particularly the performance of the three-band model due to the coarser and discontinuous spectral configuration. Contrastingly, both the GA-PLS and the three-band model show improved results with the simulated Hyperion datasets. Our observation indicates that the GA-PLS model outperforms the three-band model in terms of spatial transferability; however, the three-band model has its own merits, considering its simplicity. Further analyses indicate that spectral measurement protocols, instrumentations, and inorganic suspended matter affect the GA-PLS and three-band model performances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, accurate maps of rubber plantations are not available, which substantially constrain our understanding of the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of rubber plantation expansion. In this study we developed a simple algorithm for accurate mapping of rubber plantations in northern tropical regions, by combining a forest map derived from microwave data and unique phenological characteristics of rubber trees observed from multi-temporal Landsat imagery. Phenology of rubber trees and natural evergreen forests in Hainan Island, China, was evaluated using eighteen Landsat TM/ETM+ images between 2007 and 2012. Temporal profiles of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance for rubber trees and natural forest were constructed. The results showed that rubber plantations are distinguishable from natural evergreen forests in two phenological phases: 1) during the defoliation (leaf-off) phase in late February-March, vegetation index (NDVI, EVI, LSWI) values were lower in rubber plantations than in natural evergreen forests; and 2) during the foliation (new leaf emergence) phase in late March-April, rubber plantations had similar NDVI and LSWI values but higher EVI and NIR reflectance values than in natural forests. Therefore, it is possible to delineate rubber plantations within forested landscapes using one to two optical images acquired in the defoliation and/or foliation period. The mapping technique was developed and applied in the Danzhou Region of Hainan. Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) 50-m Orthorectified Mosaic images were used to generate a forest cover map and further integrated with the phenological information of rubber plantations extracted from Landsat TM images during the foliation phase. The resultant map of rubber plantations has high accuracy (both producer\'s and user\'s accuracy is 96%). This simple and integrated algorithm has the potential to improve mapping of rubber plantations at the regional scale. This study also shows the value of time series Landsat images and emphasizes imagery selection at appropriate phenological phase for land cover classification, especially for delineating deciduous vegetation.

A variety of area estimators have been proposed based on different approaches to using the estimated error matrix produced from an accuracy assessment along with information available from the map. These estimators include a stratified estimator (where the strata are the map classes), several model-assisted estimators incorporating the map information as auxiliary variables in a variety of different models, and a bias-adjusted estimator that corrects for classification error when area is computed directly from the map. In some cases the same area estimator results from more than one approach. For stratified random sampling with the map classes defining the strata, the model-assisted and bias-adjusted estimators are equivalent to the stratified estimator of area that would typically be used with this sampling design. Thus the commonly used stratified estimator is the lone choice for stratified random sampling. For simple random sampling, the bias-adjusted estimator and a model-assisted difference estimator are equivalent, but other model-assisted options include poststratified (i.e., applying a stratified estimator to data obtained from a simple random sample), ratio, and simple regression estimators. A simulation study demonstrates that for simple random sampling, the poststratified estimator almost always has the smallest variance among these estimators. The only exception to the superior performance of the poststratified estimator occurred when overall accuracy was very high, the true proportion of area was small (i.e., less than 2%), and the accuracy assessment sample size was small (n = 100). Because the poststratified estimator for simple random sampling is equivalent to the stratified estimator used with stratified random sampling, the stratified estimator provides a unified, simple approach to area estimation for these two commonly used sampling designs.

Per-pixel built-up area fraction was calculated using a classification and regression trees (CART) methodology integrating high- and medium-resolution satellite imagery. The likelihood layer was produced by weighting different geospatial layers according to their effect on the likelihood of population being found in the particular pixel. The geospatial layers integrated into the likelihood layer were: 1) proximity to remotely sensed built-up pixels, 2) density of settlement points in a fixed kernel, 3) slope, 4) elevation, and 5) heterogeneity of landcover types found within a search radius.

Ground-based sampling undertaken concurrent with image acquisition provided calibration data for chlorophyll, suspended solids, turbidity and other measures of water clarity. Our approach identified the spectral characteristics that distinguish waters dominated by several inherent optical properties (IOPs), and we used those characteristics to develop models to map water quality characteristics in optically complex waters. For phytoplankton related variables (volatile suspended solids (VSS) and chlorophyll a (chl a)), the ratios of the scattering peak at the red edge (similar to 700 nm) with the reflectance troughs caused by chlorophyll absorption at similar to 670 nm and other plant pigment absorption peaks at 592 and 620 nm all were strong predictors of chl a and VSS (r(2) values of 0.73-0.94). The scattering peak at similar to 700 nm was a strong predictor of variables related to water clarity (total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and turbidity tube (T-tube)) (r(2) values of 0.77-0.93). For mineral-based variables (nonvolatile suspended solids (NVSS) and the ratio NVSS:TSS), combinations of the TSS and chl a relationships described above were strong predictors (r(2) values of 0.73-0.97) and the most robust because this model corrects for the scattering of phytoplankton at similar to 700 nm. Application of the methods to quantify spatial variations in water quality for stretches of the Mississippi River and its tributaries indicate that hyperspectral imagery can be used to distinguish and map key variables under complex IOP conditions, particularly to separate and map inorganic suspended sediments independently of chlorophyll levels.

These forests are also among the most vulnerable ecosystems, both to anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Yet, no map or published study exists showing detailed spatiotemporal trends of mangrove deforestation at local to regional scales. This study uses change point and mixed-pixel analyses with a time series (2000-2010) of high-fidelity imagery from NASA\'s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for tracking deforestation of mangroves in the Mahakam Delta of Indonesia at 250 m spatial scale and a 3-monthly temporal interval. The results show that a total of 21,000 +/- 152 ha of mangrove land in the Mahakam Delta were deforested and converted to shrimp ponds in 11 years. In 2000, the deforested lands covered 47% of the entire delta, while in 2010 it increased to 75%. Deforestation rates varied in each year, but peaked in 2002 and declined since then. The combination of high-fidelity time series data and a robust method of change detection resulted in a virtual reconstruction of 11 years of drastic land change history of the delta\'s mangrove areas at a consistent spatiotemporal scale. We anticipate that the methodology developed in this study will be useful to reconstruct deforestation histories of other places as well. Also, our findings can potentially be used to further explore the socioeconomic drivers of mangrove deforestation so that reliable, appropriate and sustainable methods of local and regional scale adaptation/mitigation strategies can be developed.

The NLCD Level II (16 classes) overall accuracies for the 2001 and 2006 land cover were 79% and 78%, respectively, with Level II user\'s accuracies exceeding 80% for water, high density urban, all upland forest classes, shrubland, and cropland for both dates. Level I (8 classes) accuracies were 85% for NLCD 2001 and 84% for NLCD 2006. The high overall and user\'s accuracies for the individual dates translated into high user\'s accuracies for the 2001-2006 change reporting themes water gain and loss, forest loss, urban gain, and the no-change reporting themes for water, urban, forest and agriculture. The main factor limiting higher accuracies for the change reporting themes appeared to be difficulty in distinguishing the context of grass.

The majority of its applications, including agriculture and forestry, require a robust calibration for medium to high reflective targets. However, when imaging water resources, then the question becomes whether the calibration coefficients are valid for the dark end of the sensor\'s responsivity curve. Motivated by the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) and its potential for providing long-term, robust water studies, in this effort, the calibration status of ETM+ visible bands are examined using a cross-calibration technique. The well-calibrated Terra-MODIS scenes (collection 5) of the past decade over relatively optically stable waters were chosen to evaluate ETM+ stability. The cross-comparison showed that the calibration instability of ETM+ reflective bands lie well within its radiometric uncertainty. The slight calibration differences were found to be less than 1.6%, 0.93%, and 3.2% for the blue, green and the red bands obtained for the period when the MODIS had been radiometrically stable. The NIR band of ETM+, however, exhibits, on average, 4.8% higher signals than those of MODIS. The error budget analysis for the calibration differences showed that 1.2%, 1.6%, 3.5%, and 6.5% errors are associated with the Visible-Near-Infrared (VNIR) bands, respectively. Using the results from the calibration study combined with simulations, it was demonstrated that ETM+ underestimates the retrieved diffuse surface reflectance (R-d) in the blue and the green bands as much as 12.2% and 4.4%, respectively, while the red band is overestimated 37%, on average, when studying slightly/moderately turbid. The uncertainties in the retrieval of R-d were applied in a water constituent retrieval framework where a physics-based model was utilized to obtain concentrations of chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS) from a Landsat-7 dataset in slightly/moderately turbid waters. It was found that the calibration-induced errors in the retrieval of R-d yield, on average, 20% error in retrieval of these components. The results indicate that although ETM+ is well calibrated, its calibration status should be quantified rigorously for water studies when physics-based methods are employed for the removal of atmospheric effects. The over-water characterization of Landsat satellites will become more crucial when the LDCM becomes operational due to its increased capabilities for water resource studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The following products are compared: LSE derived by the Land Surface Analysis - Satellite Application Facility (LSA-SAF) for the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), LSE products MOD11A2.C5, MOD11B1.C4.1, and MOD11B1.C5 derived for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard EOS-Terra, LSE derived with the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) onboard EOS-Terra, and LSE derived with the TES algorithm for EOS-Terra/MODIS data. The LSA-SAF, MOD11A2.C5, and MOD11B1.C5 algorithms directly or indirectly utilize land cover classification and vegetation cover fraction data with the result that for arid regions their LSE are practically identical to the bare ground emissivities assigned to those classes. Over the gravel plains, mean LSA-SAF, ASTER-TES, and MODTES LSE are about 0.950 in the 11 mu m range, whereas mean MOD11A2.C5 and MOD11B1.C5 are about 1.5% (similar to 1 K) higher. The LSA-SAF algorithm misclassifies the sand dunes as \'open & closed shrubland\', which results in an overestimated mean LSE (0.969). Since MOD11A2.C5 and MOD11B1.C5 utilize a similar classification and similar emissivity library data, their LSE estimates for the sand dunes are also too high (mean of 0.972 and 0.980, respectively). In contrast, the physics-based ASTER-TES and MODTES algorithms estimate mean sand dune LSE as 0.952 and 0.948, respectively. The physics-based MOD11B1.C4.1 algorithm produced noisy LSE estimates with frequent outliers at 5 km resolution: spatial averaging yielded mean LSE of 0.950 and 0.954 for the gravel plains and the sand dunes, respectively. Based on a combined analysis of in-situ LSE and TES retrieved LSE, and also accounting for uncertainty in the fraction of dry grass (only gravel plains), for future work it is recommended to use SEVIRI ch10.8 emissivities of 0.941 +/- 0.004 for the sand dunes and 0.944 +/- 0.015 for the gravel plains, respectively. The results suggest that split window algorithms would benefit significantly from using physically based MODTES LSE. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Previous methodology is extended to the mapping of turbidity. T, and vertical attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), K-PAR. The spatial resolution of the SEVIRI products is improved from 3 km x 6.5 km to 1 km x 2 km using the broad high resolution visual band. The previous atmospheric correction is further improved and the uncertainties on marine reflectance due to digitization are considered. Based on a two year archive of SEVIRI imagery, available every 15 min, the diurnal variability of T and K-PAR is investigated during cloud free periods and validated using half-hourly T and K-PAR data obtained from a system of moored buoys (SmartBuoys) in the southern North Sea. Based on numerous match-ups, 80% of SEVIRI derived T and K-PAR are within 53% and 39% of SmartBuoy T and K-PAR, respectively. Results further show that on cloud free days, the SEVIRI T and Km signals are in phase with the SmartBuoy data, with an average difference in the timing of the maximum T and K-PAR of 11 min and 23 min, respectively. It is concluded that diurnal variability of T and K-PAR can now be mapped by remote sensing offering new opportunities for improving ecosystem models and monitoring of turbidity. Limitations of the current SEVIRI sensor and perspectives for design of future geostationary sensors and synergy with polar orbiting satellites are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We applied Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) inputting five endmembers: char, green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), substrate and shadow. Results revealed that fractional cover estimates of char, NPV and substrate are 5-7% better when VSWIR-MTIR data were combined, compared to using only VSWIR data. Combined VSWIR-MTIR imagery will become available at pixel sizes smaller than 100 m with future satellite sensors, such as the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI). The MESMA-derived char fractional cover was also shown to be strongly correlated with the Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI, R-adj(2) = 0.82) and the percentage of black trees and shrubs (R-adj(2) = 0.66) measured in the field.

The Long Term Data Record (LTDR [Pedelty et al., 2007]), which provides AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data from these satellites for the 80s and the 90s, is also affected by this orbital drift. To correct this effect on Land Surface Temperature (LST) time series, a novel method is presented here, which consists in adjusting retrieved LST time series on the basis of statistical information extracted from the time series themselves. This method is as simple and straightforward as possible, in order to be implemented easily for such a large dataset as the LTDR. The correction is applied on a pixel by pixel basis, and relies on a 2nd order polynomial fit of per satellite solar zenithal angle (SZA) anomalies against time. If the pixel time series is identified as contaminated by the orbital drift for any of the different satellite active periods, LST anomalies are fitted linearly against both time and the 2nd order polynomial fit of SZA anomalies. This double fit allows for the removal of orbital drift influence without removing eventual trends in the signal, which is of utmost importance for vegetation change detection. When applied to simulated LST time series, this method shows errors comparable to the errors associated to LST estimation for most cases. When applied to LTDR LST time series, the approach normalizes the distribution of LST values at the beginning and end of each satellite activity period, and visual inspection of the time series does not show any residual orbital drift in the corrected EST time series. The approach also improves the significance of retrieved trends through the whole time span of the LTDR dataset. The application of this method to the whole LTDR dataset could lead to the compilation of the first coherent global dataset of land surface temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To this end, two major techniques were combined: Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM). OBIA was used to represent the knowledge needed to map sugarcane, whereas DM was applied to generate the knowledge model. To derive the image objects, the segmentation algorithm implemented in Definiens Developer (R) was used. The data mining algorithm used was J48, which generates decision trees (DT) from a previously prepared training set. The study area comprises three municipalities located in the northwest of Sao Paulo state, all of which are good representatives of the agricultural conditions in the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. A time series of Landsat TM and ETM+ images was acquired in order to represent the wide range of pattern variation along the sugarcane crop cycle. After training, the DT was applied to the Landsat time series, thus generating the desired thematic map with sugarcane ready to harvest. Classification accuracy was calculated over a set of 500 points not previously used during the training stage. Using error matrix analysis and Kappa statistics, tests for statistical significance were derived. The statistics indicated that the classification achieved an overall accuracy of 94% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.87.

This was made possible via an exhaustive mining of the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) archive. A total of 8881 images were processed to create multi-temporal image metrics resulting in 99.6% of the DRC land area covered by cloud-free Landsat observations. To facilitate image compositing, a top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance calibration and image normalization using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) top of canopy (TOC) reflectance data sets were performed. Mapping and change detection was implemented using a classification tree algorithm. The national year 2000 forest cover was estimated to be 159,529.2 thousand hectares, with gross forest cover loss for the last decade totaling 2.3% of forest area. Forest cover loss area increased by 13.8% between the 2000-2005 and 2005-2010 intervals, with the greatest increase occurring within primary humid tropical forests. Forest loss intensity was distributed unevenly and associated with areas of high population density and mining activity. While forest cover loss is comparatively low in protected areas and priority conservation landscapes compared to forests outside of such areas, gross forest cover loss for all nature protection areas increased by 64% over the 2000 to 2005 and 2005 to 2010 intervals.

A secondary forest succession is defined here as regrowth of woody vegetation following a complete or heavy forest clearance for pasture, agriculture, or other human activity. We first compare the known spatial distribution of three main TDF successional stages (Early, Intermediate and Late successional stages) as constrained by published field observations of tree height with that obtained from a three-class classification of the LIDAR data. In doing so we explicitly assess the possibility of using LIDAR data to map the distribution of the three main TDFs stages. We demonstrates that changes in the forest vertical structure (such as height) associated with principal successional stages (Early, Intermediate and Late) of TDF secondary growth can be effectively identified from LIDAR data. The successional sequence observed is related to changes in the vertical distribution of woody components that occur when forest patches evolve from an Early Stage which is dominated by sparse trees and grass, to initial stages of intermediate secondary succession characterized by small canopies and a high density of understory regeneration, and then to more complex and developed stages of intermediate and late stage secondary succession which share some attributes of Old growth forests. We then focus on the Intermediate successional Stage since it is of highest interest to policy makers dealing with programs implementing payments for environmental services. We show that an analysis of the LIDAR data can identify successional three subclasses within the Intermediate Stage providing further insights in the development of secondary forest growth. A validation of the three new forest classes is provided using field observations showing a mean tree height and standard deviation of 6.16 +/- 0.87, 7.82 +/- 0.31 and 8.62 +/- 1.22. m.

The high energy balance closure of 93% at the site, the high correspondence of modelled temperature profile data to observations, and agreement of retrieved thermal properties with literature data gave confidence in the validation target. The remote sensing method makes use of retrieved radiometric temperatures and night-time net radiation. It was applied to field radiometry measurements over bare soil and to MSG-SEVERI data (10% of the pixel of the field site was covered by vegetation). Despite its simplicity, the remote sensing model applied to the field radiometry performed well (slope of the regression against the validation target: 1.00, r(2) = 0.96).

As a result, empirical estimates are typically made to characterize attributes such as height, volume, or biomass, with known asymptotic relationships as signal saturation occurs. Lidar (light detection and ranging) has emerged as a robust means to collect and subsequently characterize vertically distributed attributes. Lidar has been established as an appropriate data source for forest inventory purposes; however, large area monitoring and mapping activities with lidar remain challenging due to the logistics, costs, and data volumes involved. The use of lidar as a sampling tool for large-area estimation may mitigate some or all of these problems. A number of factors drive, and are common to, the use of airborne profiling, airborne scanning, and spaceborne lidar systems as sampling tools for measuring and monitoring forest resources across areas that range in size from tens of thousands to millions of square kilometers. In this communication, we present the case for lidar sampling as a means to enable timely and robust large-area characterizations. We briefly outline the nature of different lidar systems and data, followed by the theoretical and statistical underpinnings for lidar sampling. Current applications are presented and the future potential of using lidar in an integrated sampling framework for large area ecosystem characterization and monitoring is presented. We also include recommendations regarding statistics, lidar sampling schemes, applications (including data integration and stratification), and subsequent information generation.

This paper investigates how the wide observation angles of MODIS influence the current snow mapping algorithm in forested areas. Theoretical modeling results indicate that large view zenith angles (VZA) can lead to underestimation of fractional snow cover (FSC) by reducing the amount of the ground surface that is viewable through forest canopies, and by increasing uncertainties during the gridding of MODIS data. At the end of the MODIS scan line, the total modeled error can be as much as 50% for FSC. Empirical analysis of MODIS/Terra snow products in four forest sites shows high fluctuation in FSC estimates on consecutive days. In addition, the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) values, which are the primary input to the MODIS snow mapping algorithms, decrease as VZA increases at the site level. At the pixel level. NDSI values have higher variances, and are correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in snow covered forests. These findings are consistent with our modeled results, and imply that consideration of view angle effects could improve MODIS snow monitoring in forested areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A history of ice elevation change is found by differencing ASTER Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) relative to a void-filled version of the DEM collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in February 2000. Thinning rates have accelerated at lower elevations, while above the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) recent thinning rates are not significantly different from those observed in previous studies. A volumetric change of -4.06 +/- 0.11 km(3)/yr is found by summing surface elevation changes over all glaciers in the NPI. This is regarded as a lower bound because volume loss due to frontal retreat and sub-aqueous melting is not included. This volume change is converted to a mass loss of 3.40 +/- 0.07 Gt/yr, taking into account density differences above and below the equilibrium line. We find that the NPI is providing at least 0.009 +/- 0.0002 mm/yr to ongoing sea level change, in agreement with previous estimates.   Sub-pixel offset tracking of ASTER image pairs is used to produce glacier displacements over intervals typically ranging from 6 days to 18 months. The first whole icefield composite velocity map is presented. The terminus of the San Rafael Glacier, on the western side of the NPI sustained a peak calving front speed of 19.7 +/- 1.2 m/day for 7 days in the austral fall of 2007. Passive microwave observations indicate that the surface of the accumulation basin of the glacier was wet during this period of rapid motion, suggesting that the fast speed may be a consequence of a rise in sub-glacial water pressure, sourced from melt or rainwater making its way to the glacier bed and reducing basal friction. Several other outlet glaciers, including the Benito and HPN1 glaciers, on the isolated western side of the icefield accelerated while thinning between 2007 and 2011. Marked acceleration also occurred after 2007 at the front of the San Quintin Glacier, the largest outlet glacier of the NPI.   The paucity of thickness measurements at the outlet glaciers means it is impossible to accurately gauge the mass flux of the icefield and thus give a full estimate of the mass balance.

This paper presents the results of a project to combine SSTs from two instruments: the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) SSTs and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder SSTs. The dual-view nature of the (A)ATSR series of radiometers enables high-quality sea surface temperatures to be retrieved. These SSTs are ideal for using as a reference in order to bias-adjust the AVHRR series of instruments. In addition a method to correct for aerosol effects in the AVHRR SSTs is employed using aerosol optical depth from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer. The method enables positive characteristics of both datasets to be combined to provide a dataset of potentially high-quality, long time-series, large data coverage satellite sea surface temperatures for climate monitoring purposes.   An AVHRR SST dataset at 1/4 degree spatial resolution with associated systematic biases and uncertainties is produced for climate research covering the period 1985 to 1998. The method is used to produce improved AVHRR SSTs for the period 1991 to the present (when the ATSRs are available) and additionally the method can be used to estimate biases on AVHRR SSTs prior to the first ATSR launch (1985 to 1991).   The bias-correction has the effect of reducing an observed cool bias in the AVHRR SSTs, relative to the Hadley Centre Sea-Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST), especially in cases of high volcanic and Saharan dust aerosol. The time-series indicates that the bias correction scheme is effective during the 1990s at decreasing the cool bias in the AVHRR SSTs. The scheme is especially effective in times of high atmospheric volcanic aerosol levels such as the period following the Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991.

However, reducing the noise in backscatter response not related to soil moisture often results in signal losses that are related to soil moisture. In this study we tested whether a spatial averaging scheme based on topographic features improved regressions relating backscatter coefficient and soil moisture on the low relief landscape of the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada. Soil moisture data were collected along hillslope transects within pothole drainage basins at intervals coincident with RADARSAT-1 satellite overpass. Spatial averaging schemes were designed at four scales: pixel, topographic feature (uplands, side-slopes, and lowlands), pothole drainage basin, and landscape (0.8 km x 1.6 km). The relationship between soil moisture and backscatter coefficient improved with increasing area of spatial averaging from a pixel (R-2=0.18, P<0.005), to the pothole drainage basin (R-2=0.36, P<0.005), to the landscape (R-2=0.66, P<0.005). However, the strongest relationship (R-2=0.72, P<0.005) was obtained by spatially averaging radar images based on topographic features. These findings indicate that topographically based spatial averaging of RADARSAT-1 imagery improves empirical models that are created to map the complex patterns of soil moisture in prairie pothole landscapes.

This study uses a physical approach to remove surface topography effect from lidar returns to retrieve vegetation height from ICESat/GLAS data over slope terrains.   Slope-corrected vegetation heights from ICESat/GLAS data were compared to airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) (20 m footprint size) and small-footprint lidar data collected in White Mountain National Forest, NH. Impact of slope on LVIS vegetation height estimates was assessed by comparing LVIS height before and after slope correction with small-footprint discrete-return lidar and field data. Slope-corrected GLAS vegetation heights match well with 98 percentile heights from small-footprint lidar (R-2=0.77, RMSE=2.2 m) and top three LVIS mean (slope-corrected) heights (R-2=0.64, RMSE=3.7 m). Impact of slope on LVIS heights is small, however, comparison of LVIS heights (without slope correction) with either small footprint lidar or field data indicates that our scheme improves the overall LVIS height accuracy by 0.4-0.7 m in this region. Vegetation height can be overestimated by 3m over a 15 degrees slope without slope correction. More importantly, both slope-corrected GLAS and LVIS height differences are independent of slope. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the physical approach to remove surface topography from large footprint lidar data to improve accuracy of maximum vegetation height estimates.   GLAS waveforms were compared to aggregated LVIS waveforms in Bartlett Experimental Forest, NH, to evaluate the impact of background noise and sensor saturation on vegetation structure retrievals from ICESat/GLAS. We found that GLAS waveforms with sensor saturation and low background noise match well with aggregated LVIS waveforms, indicating these waveforms capture vertical vegetation structure well. However, waveforms with large noise often lead to mismatched waveforms with LVIS and underestimation of waveform extent and vegetation height. These results demonstrate the quality of ICESat/GLAS vegetation structure estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Various methods have been successfully implemented to estimate forest biochemical and biophysical variables from atmospherically-corrected multi-angular data, but the use of physically based radiative transfer (RT) models is still limited. Because both canopy and atmosphere have an anisotropic behaviour, it is important to understand the multi-angular signal measured by the sensor at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). Coupled canopy-atmosphere RT models allow linking surface variables directly to the TOA radiance measured by the sensor and are therefore very interesting tools to use for estimating forest variables from multi-angular data.   We investigated the potential of TOA multi-angular radiance data for estimating forest variables by inverting a coupled canopy-atmosphere physical RT model. The case study focussed on three Norway spruce stands located at the Bily Kriz experimental site (Czech Republic), for which multi-angular CHRIS and field data were acquired in September 2006. The soil-leaf-canopy RI model SLC and the atmospheric model MODTRAN4 were coupled using a method allowing to make full use of the four canopy angular reflectance components provided by SLC. The TOA radiance simulations were in good agreement with the spectral and angular signatures measured by CHRIS. Singular value decompositions of the Jacobian matrices showed that the dimensionality of the variable estimation problem increased from 3 to 6 when increasing the number of observation angles from 1 to 4. The model inversion was conducted for two cases: 4 and 7 variables. The most influential parameters were chosen as free variables in the look-up tables, namely: vertical crown cover (Cv), fraction of bark material (fl3), needle chlorophyll content (needleCab), needle dry matter content (needleCdm) for the 4-variable case, and additionally, tree shape factor (Zeta), dissociation factor (D), and needle brown pigments content (needleCs) in the 7-variable case. All angular combinations were tested, and the best estimates were obtained with combinations using two or three angles, depending on the number of variables and on the stand used. Overall, this case study showed that, although making use of its full potential is still a challenge, TOA multi-angular radiance data do have a higher potential for variable estimation than mono-angular data.

The study reveals a good agreement between ASRVN and RSG HDRF for both MODIS Terra and Aqua with rmse -0.01-0.025 in the 500 m MODIS land bands B1-B7. Obtained rinse is below uncertainties due to the spatial and seasonal variability of the bright calibration 1 km(2) area. While two MODIS instruments have a similar rmse in the visible bands, MODIS Aqua has a better agreement (lower arise) with the ground data than MODIS Terra at wavelengths 0.87-2.1 mu m. An independent overall good agreement of two MODIS instruments with the ground data indicates that the relative calibration of MODIS Terra and Aqua at medium-to-bright reflectance levels for the stated time period is significantly better than uncertainties of the ASRVN and ground data.

Albedo information at fine spatial resolution is particularly useful for quantifying climate impacts associated with land use change and ecosystem disturbance. The derived white-sky and black-sky spectral albedos may be used to estimate actual spectral albedos by taking into account the proportion of direct and diffuse solar radiation arriving at the ground. A further spectral-to-broadband conversion based on extensive radiative transfer simulations is applied to produce the broadband albedos at visible, near infrared, and shortwave regimes. The accuracy of this approach has been evaluated using 270 Landsat scenes covering six field stations supported by the SURFace RADiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains (ARM/SGP) network Comparison with field measurements shows that Landsat 30-m snow-free shortwave albedos from all seasons generally achieve an absolute accuracy of +/- 0.02-0.05 for these validation sites during available clear days in 2003-2005, with a root mean square error less than 0.03 and a bias less than 0.02. This level of accuracy has been regarded as sufficient for driving global and regional climate models. The Landsat-based retrievals have also been compared to the operational 16-day MODIS albedo produced every 8-days from MODIS on Terra and Aqua (MCD43A). The Landsat albedo provides more detailed landscape texture, and achieves better agreement (correlation and dynamic range) with in-situ data at the validation stations, particularly when the stations include a heterogeneous mix of surface covers.

This complex typically consists of altered dunites and peridotites, layered and massive gabbros, sheeted dykes and pillow lavas, and a thick sequence of radiolarites. Reflectance and emittance spectra of Neyriz ophiolite rock samples were measured in the laboratory and their spectra were used as endmembers in a spectral feature fitting (SF) algorithm. Laboratory spectral reflectance measurements of field samples showed that in the visible through shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) wavelength region the ultramafic and gabbroic rocks are characterized by ferrous-iron and Fe, Mg-OH spectral features, and the pillow lavas and radiolarites are characterized by spectral features of ferric-iron and Al-OH. The laboratory spectral emittance spectra also revealed a wide wavelength range of Si-O spectral features for the ophiolite rock units. After continuum removal of the spectra, the SF classification method was applied to the VNIR + SWIR 9-band stack, and to the 11-band data set of SWIR and TIR data sets of the Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor, using field spectra as training sets for evaluating the potential of these data sets in discriminating ophiolite rock units. Output results were compared with the geological map of the area and field observations, and were assessed by the use of confusion matrices. The assessment showed, in terms of kappa coefficient, that the SFF classification method with continuum removal applied to the SWIR data achieved excellent results, which were distinctively better than those obtained using VNIR + SWIR data and TIR data alone.

Large-scale application of the data for forest stem volume mapping, however, is hindered by the variability of coherence with meteorological and environmental acquisition conditions. The traditional way of stem volume retrieval is based on the training of models, relating coherence to stem volume, with the aid of forest inventory data which is generally available for a few small test sites but not for large areas. In this paper a new approach is presented that allows model training using the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields canopy cover product (Hansen et al., 2003) without further need for ground data. A comparison of the new approach with the traditional regression-based and ground-data dependent model training is presented in this paper for a multiseasonal ERS-1/2 tandem dataset covering several well known Central Siberian forest sites. As a test scenario for large-area application, the approach was applied to a multi-seasonal ERS-1/2 tandem dataset of 223 ERS-1 and ERS-2 image pairs covering Northeast China (similar to 1.5 million km(2)) to map four stem volume classes (0-20, 20-50, 50-80, and >80 m(3)/ha).

We develop two methods of classification. The first method is obtained from a k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classifier, which represents a simple machine learning algorithm in pattern recognition. The second method is hybrid in that it combines k-NN clustering, hierarchical principles and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The nomenclature of the two classifications relies on three levels of vegetation structural categories based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). The two main outcomes are: (i) The delineation of the spatial distribution of ecosystems into five bioclimatic ecoregions at the African continental scale; (ii) Two ecosystem maps were made sequentially: an initial map with 92 ecosystems from the k-NN, plus a deduced hybrid classification with 73 classes, which better reflects the bio-geographical patterns. The inclusion of bioclimatic information and successive k-NN clustering elements helps to enhance the discrimination of ecosystems. Adopting this hybrid approach makes the ecosystem identification and labelling more flexible and more accurate in comparison to straightforward methods of classification. The validation of the hybrid classification, conducted by crossing-comparisons with validated continental maps, displayed a mapping accuracy of 54% to 61%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Reliable automated methods are only beginning to appear; for instance, through the recent development of textural approaches applied to high resolution optical imagery. In particular, the Fourier Transform Textural Ordination (FOTO) method shows some potential to provide non-saturating estimates of tropical forest structure, including for large scale applications. However, we need to understand more precisely how canopy structure interacts with physical signals (light) to produce a given texture, notably to assess the method\'s sensitivity to varying sun-view acquisition conditions. In this study, we take advantage of the detailed description of canopy topography provided by airborne small footprint LiDAR data acquired over the Paracou forest experimental station in French Guiana. Using hillshade models and a range of sun-view angles identical to the actual parameter distributions found for Quickbird (TM) images over the Amazon, we study noise and bias in texture estimation induced by the changing configurations. We introduce the bidirectional texture function, which summarizes these effects, and in particular the existence of a textural \'hot spot\', similar to a well-known feature of bidirectional reflectance studies. For texture, this effect implies that coarseness decreases in configurations for which shadows are concealed to the observer. We also propose a method, termed partitioned standardization, that allows mitigating acquisition effects and discuss the potential for an operational use of VHR optical imagery and the FOTO method in the current context of international decisions to reduce CO2 emissions due to deforestation and forest degradation.

In this research, detection accuracy of start of season (SOS) phenology for deciduous forest across Eastern Canada was assessed using satellite time series and in situ PlantWatch observations. Several aspects were evaluated regarding performance of phenology information extraction: 1) effect of compositing period, 2) individual performance of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensors, and 3) performance for these sensors combined. The AVHRR and MERIS sensors were used as they are overlapping operational missions with planned future continuity. Three approaches to utilizing the multi-sensor data were tested: 1) inter-calibrating NDVI data between sensors and using the multi-sensor data stream to detect SOS, 2) combining independently derived SOS estimates from AVHRR and MERIS based on a weighted average, and 3) combining approaches 1 and 2. Comparison with in situ observations of leaf out and first bloom showed that combining independent SOS estimates from AVHRR and MERIS was better than using the inter-calibrated multi-sensor data. Combining SOS estimates from both sensors reduced error by 1-2 days compared to the individual sensor results. Composite periods from 7 to 11 days produced the best results for leaf out with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5 days. Results for first bloom were not as good as those for leaf out, producing a MAE of 6.5 days. For first bloom, compositing periods greater than 11 days did not increase error at the same rate as seen for leaf out. However, the larger MAE observed for first bloom may have masked this effect.

These benefits are a function of the amount of cover crop biomass that enters the soil. The ability to easily and inexpensively quantify the spatial variability of cover crop biomass is needed to better understand and predict its potential as an input to agricultural systems. Here, we explore the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a source of information for improving accuracy and precision of cover crop biomass prediction. We focus on developing models that account for biomass variability within and among fields. These models are used to produce digital data layers of predicted biomass and associated uncertainty. We propose hierarchical nonlinear models with field random effects and a residual variance function to accommodate strong heteroscedasticity. These models are motivated using aboveground biomass of red clover (Trifolium pratense L) measured on three different dates in five fields in southwest Michigan. Model adequacy was assessed using the Deviance Information Criterion. Given this criterion, the \"best\" fitting model included field effects and a polynomial function to account for non-constant residual variance. Importantly, we demonstrate that accounting for heteroscedasticity in the model fitting is critical for capturing uncertainty in subsequent biomass prediction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Algorithm validation was performed within Canadian Arctic waters using the Canadian Ice Service Digital Archive (CISDA) ice charts, NASATeam ice concentration estimates, extended AVHRR Polar Pathfinder (APP-x) albedo data, RADARSAT-1 imagery, and MODIS imagery. Results indicate that the temporal evolution of QuikSCAT sigma degrees, AMSR-E polarization ratio (PR18), and AMSR-E vertical spectral gradient ratio (GR3618) can detect water clear of sea ice events, however mean differences due to frequency dependent characteristics of the data (spatial resolution; sensitivity to open water) were apparent. All water clear of sea ice algorithms are in good agreement with the timing and clearing patterns given by the CISDA. The QuikSCAT algorithm provided a more representative ice edge and more details on the ice clearing process due to higher spatial resolution, however, transient clearing events were better represented by the AMSR-E PR(18) or (GR3618) algorithm. By exploiting the strengths of each sensor, we found that a QuikSCAT and AMSR-E fused algorithm provide improved open water area estimates by as much as 11%. The fusion of QuikSCAT and AMSR-E PR(18) yielded in the most spatially representative open water detection. The residual surface of the water clear of sea ice algorithms was found to provide another measure of the average September minimum pan-Arctic sea ice extent within 6% of the NASATeam algorithm estimates.

Eddy covariance and chamber GPP, incoming and reflected photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), field-measured spectral reflectance, and data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used in this study. The chamber and spectral reflectance measurements were made on four experimental treatments: unfertilized control (Ctrl). nitrogen fertilized (N), phosphorus fertilized (P), and nitrogen plus phosphorus fertilized (NP). For Ctrl, a strong linear relationship was found between GPP and the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (APAR) (R-2=0.90). The slope coefficient (epsilon(s), where s stands for \"slope\") for the linear relationship between seasonal time series of GPP and the product of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and PPFD was used as a proxy for the light use efficiency factor (epsilon). There were differences in epsilon(s) depending on the treatments with a significant effect for N compared to Ctrl (ANOVA: p = 0.042, Tukey\'s: p <= 0.05). Also. epsilon(s) was linearly related to the cover degree of vascular plants (R-2= 0.66). As a sensitivity test, the regression coefficients (epsilon(s) and intercept) for each treatment were used to model time series of 16-day GPP from the product of MODIS NDVI and PPFD. Seasonal averages of GPP were calculated for 2005, 2006. and 2007, which resulted in up to 19% higher average GPP for the fertilization treatments compared to Ctrl. The main conclusion is that the LUE model and the regression model can be applied in peatlands but also that temporal and spatial changes in epsilon or the regression coefficients should be considered.

Construction of the maps typically entails, in part, rectifying the satellite images to a geographic coordinate system, observing ground plots whose coordinates are obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers that are calibrated to the same geographic coordinate system, and then matching ground plots to image pixels containing the centers of the ground plots. Errors in rectification and GPS coordinates cause observations of ground attributes to be associated with spectral values of incorrect pixels which, in turn, introduces classification errors into the resulting maps. The most important finding of the study is that for common magnitudes of rectification and GPS errors, as many as half the ground plots may be assigned to incorrect pixels. The effects on areal estimates obtained by aggregating class predictions for individual pixels are deviation of the estimates from their true values, erroneous confidence intervals, and incorrect inferences. Results are reported in detail for both probability-based (design-based) and model-based approaches to inference for proportion forest area using maps constructed from Landsat imagery, forest inventory plot observations and a logistic regression model.

Laboratory measurements were used to simulate the effects of rainfall and subsequent surface evaporation on the LSE for two different sand types. The results showed that the LSE returned to the dry equilibrium state within an hour after initial wetting, and during the drying process the SM changes were uncorrelated with changes in LSE. Satellite retrievals of LSE from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were examined for an anomalous rainfall event over the Namib Desert in Namibia during April, 2006. The results showed that increases in Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) derived soil moisture and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall estimates corresponded closely with LSE increases of between 0.08-0.3 at 8.6 mu m and up to 0.03 at 11 mu m for MODIS v4 and AIRS products. This dependence was lost in the more recent MODIS v5 product which artificially removed the correlation due to a stronger coupling with the split-window algorithm, and is lost in any algorithms that force the LSE to a predetermined constant as in split-window type algorithms like those planned for use with the NPOESS Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Good agreement was found between MODIS land surface temperatures (LSTs) derived from the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) and day/night v4 algorithm (MOD11B1 v4), while the split-window dependent products (MOD11B1 v5 and MOD11A1) had cooler mean temperatures on the order of 1-2 K over the Namib Desert for the month of April 2006.

The relationship between spaceborne hyperspectral remotely sensed data and several measures of forest structure was explored over a 625 km(2) coastal temperate forest landscape on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Thirteen Hyperion bands were selected for analysis based on the documented and hypothesized importance of various spectral wavelengths to forest characterization. To aid in understanding spectral trends, measures of forest stand structural diversity (projected age, projected height, and stand species composition complexity) were derived from forest inventory data. The spectral distance between the stand mean and standard deviation of reflectance and related expectations from global equivalents for each of the 13 bands were used to relate measures of spectral diversity (N = 801 forest inventory stands).   Canonical correlation analysis was then used to determine the independent and shared relationships between these selected measures of forest structural diversity (dependent variables) and spectral diversity (independent variables). The dependent variables that were most strongly correlated with the first canonical variate were projected age and projected height, with canonical loadings of 0.973 and 0.979, respectively. In contrast, stand species composition complexity had a weak, negative correlation with spectral diversity (canonical loading = -0.025). The wavelengths contributing the most to the canonical function included: 681-740 nm, 551-680 nm, and 1401-2400 nm. There have been few studies that attempt to directly link spectral and species diversity in temperate forest environments. From this initial investigation, we posit that the complex spectral response of coastal temperate forests may confound efforts to directly link spectral and species diversity across a range of site conditions. Our results, which are constrained by the spectral and spatial resolution of the data used, our target environment, and the metrics selected for measuring forest structure, suggest that attributes that characterize forest structural conditions may have a more meaningful relationship with spectral diversity than measures of species diversity alone, and that future studies in coastal temperate forests that seek to link spectral diversity with biodiversity should include measures of forest structural diversity, in addition to measures of species diversity.

During the same period, field studies have documented statistical relationships between variables quantifying aspects of the reef habitat and its fish community. Although the results of these studies are ambiguous, some habitat variables have frequently been found to correlate with one or more aspects of the fish community. Several of these habitat variables, including depth, the structural complexity of the substrate, and live coral cover, are possible to estimate with remote sensing data. In this study, we combine a set of statistical and machine-learning models with habitat variables derived from IKONOS data to produce spatially explicit predictions of the species richness, biomass, and diversity of the fish community around two reefs in Zanzibar. In the process, we assess the ability of IKONOS imagery to estimate live coral cover, structural complexity and habitat diversity, and we explore the importance of habitat variables, at a range of spatial scales, in the predictive models using a permutation-based technique. Our findings indicate that structural complexity at a fine spatial scale (similar to 5 to 10 m) is the most important habitat variable in predictive models of fish species richness and diversity, whereas other variables such as depth, habitat diversity, and structural complexity at coarser spatial scales contribute to predictions of biomass. In addition, our results demonstrate that complex model types such as tree-based ensemble techniques provide superior predictive performance compared to the more frequently used linear models, achieving a reduction of the cross-validated root-mean-squared prediction error of 3-11%. Although aerial photographs and airborne lidar instruments have recently been used to produce spatially explicit predictions of reef fish community variables, our study illustrates the possibility of doing so with satellite data. The ability to use satellite data may bring the cost of creating such maps within the reach of both spatial ecology researchers and the wide range of organizations involved in marine spatial planning.

Small-scale surface roughness significantly impacts the microwave emission of the sea ice/snow surface; however, published results of surface roughness measurements of sea ice are rare. Knowing the refractive index is important to discriminate between objects. In this study, the small-scale roughness and refractive index over sea ice are estimated with AMSR-E observations and a unique method. Consequently, the small-scale surface roughness of 0.25 cm to 0.5 cm at AMSR-E 6.9 GHz shows reasonable agreement with the results of known observations, ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm for the sea ice in the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The refractive indexes are retrieved from 1.6 to 1.8 for winter, from 1.2 to 1.4 for summer in the Arctic and the Antarctic, which are similar to those of the sea ice and results from previous studies. This research shows the physical characteristics of the sea ice edges and melting process. Accordingly, this investigation provides an effective procedure for retrieving the small-scale roughness and refractive index of sea ice and snow. Another advantage of this study is the ability to distinguish sea ice from the sea surface by their relative small-scale roughness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To improve this situation, monitoring efforts in these complex ecosystems need to be intensified, and new, efficient monitoring techniques should be developed. In this context, our research assessed the use of IKONOS satellite imagery to map plant communities at Tivoli Bays, in the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HRNERR). Tivoli Bays, a freshwater tidal wetland, contains a unique assemblage of plant communities, including three invasive plants (Trapa natans, Phragmites australis, and Lythrum salicaria). To study the effects of textural information on the accuracy of land cover maps produced for the HRNERR, seven different 11-class land cover maps were produced using a maximum-likelihood classification on seven combinations of spectral and textural data derived from an IKONOS image. Conventional contingency tables served as a basis for an accuracy assessment of these maps. The overall classification accuracies, as assessed by the contingency tables, ranged from 45% to 77.7%. The maximum-likelihood classification relying on four spectral and four 5-by-5 filter textural bands (created by superposing a textural filter separately on each band of the IKONOS image) had the lowest overall accuracy, whereas the one based on four spectral and four 3-by-3 filter textural bands associated with all segments, identified by an object-based classification of the IKONOS image, had the highest accuracy. Results suggest that a combination of per-pixel classification and incorporation of texture for segments generated through an object-based classification slightly increases classification accuracy from 76.2% for the maximum-likelihood classification of the four spectral bands of the IKONOS image to 77.7% for the combination of spectral and textural information produced for selected segments. Further analysis indicates that better results may be obtained by using other types of data within the segments and that the traditional approach to the selection of training and accuracy sites may negatively bias the results for a combination per-pixel and object-based classification.

To better understand the ability of remote sensing to detect climate impacts on tundra vegetation productivity, we applied a photosynthetic light use efficiency model to simulated climate change treatments of tundra vegetation. We examined changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and photosynthetic light use efficiency (epsilon) in experimental warming and moisture treatments designed to simulate climate change in northern Alaska. Plots were warmed either passively, using Open Top Chambers, or actively using electric heaters in the soil. In one set of plots water table depth was actively altered, while other plots were established in locations that were naturally wet or dry. Over two growing seasons, plot-level carbon flux and spectral reflectance measurements were collected, and the results were used to derive a light use efficiency model that could explore the effects of moisture and temperature treatments using remote sensing.   Warming increased values of canopy greenness (NDVI) relative to control plots, this effect being more pronounced in wet plots than in dry plots. Light use efficiency (LUE), the relationship between absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and gross ecosystem production (CEP), was consistent across warming treatments, growing season, subsequent years, and sites. However, LUE was affected by vegetation type, which varied with moisture; plots in naturally dry locations showed reduced light use efficiency relative to moist plots. Additionally moss exhibited reduced LUE relative to vascular plants. Understory moss production, not accounted for by the usual definition of the fraction of absorbed PAR (f(APAR)), was found to be a significant part of total GEP, particularly in areas with low vascular plant cover. These results support the use of light use efficiency models driven by spectral reflectance for estimating GEP in tundra vegetation, provided effects of vegetation functional type (e.g. mosses versus vascular plants) and microtopography are considered.

Monitoring and management plans are required to solve this problem effectively. The Tabriz metropolitan area in Iran, selected as a case study for this research, is an example of a fast growing city. Multi-temporal images acquired by Landsat 4, 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors on 30 June 1989, 18 August 1998, and 2 August 2001 respectively, were corrected for radiometric and geometric errors, and processed to extract WLC classes and land surface temperature (LST). The relationship between temporal dynamics of LST and LULC was then examined. The temperature vegetation index (TVX) space was constructed in order to study the temporal variability of thermal data and vegetation cover. Temporal trajectory of pixels in the TVX space showed that most changes due to urbanization were observable as the pixels migrated from the low temperature-dense vegetation condition to the high temperature-sparse vegetation condition in the TVX space. The uncertainty analysis revealed that the trajectory analysis in the TVX space involved a class-dependant noise component. This emphasized the need for multiple WLC control points in the TVX space. In addition, this research suggests that the use of multi-temporal satellite data together with the examination of changes in the TVX space is effective and useful in urban WLC change monitoring and analysis of urban surface temperature conditions as long as the uncertainty is addressed.

Developing new techniques to remotely map snags and understory shrubs is therefore an important need. To address this, we first evaluated the use of LiDAR data for mapping the presence/absence of understory shrub species and different snag diameter classes important for birds (i.e. >= 15 cm, >= 25 cm and >= 30 cm) in a 30.000 ha mixed-conifer forest in Northern Idaho (USA). We used forest inventory plots, LiDAR-derived metrics, and the Random Forest algorithm to achieve classification accuracies of 83% for the understory shrubs and 86% to 88% for the different snag diameter classes. Second, we evaluated the use of LiDAR data for mapping wildlife habitat suitability using four avian species (one flycatcher and three woodpeckers) as case studies. For this, we integrated LiDAR-derived products of forest structure with available models of habitat suitability to derive a variety of species-habitat associations (and therefore habitat suitability patterns) across the study area. We found that the value of LiDAR resided in the ability to quantify 1) ecological variables that are known to influence the distribution of understory vegetation and snags, such as canopy cover, topography, and forest succession, and 2) direct structural metrics that indicate or suggest the presence of shrubs and snags, such as the percent of vegetation returns in the lower strata of the canopy (for the shrubs) and the vertical heterogeneity of the forest canopy (for the snags). When applied to wildlife habitat assessment, these new LiDAR-based maps refined habitat predictions in ways not previously attainable using other remote sensing technologies. This study highlights new value of LiDAR in characterizing key forest structure components important for wildlife, and warrants further applications to other forested environments and wildlife species.

Assessing the VCF\'s performance near the northern limits of the boreal forest can help quantify the accuracy of the product within this vegetation transition area. The circumpolar region was divided into 7 longitudinal zones and validation sites were selected in areas of varying tree cover where Quickbird imagery is available in Google Earth. Each site was linked to the corresponding VCF pixel and overlaid with a regular dot grid within the VCF pixel\'s boundary to estimate percent tree crown cover in the area. Percent tree crown cover was estimated using Quickbird imagery for 396 sites throughout the circumpolar region and related to the VCFs estimates of canopy cover for 2000-2005. Regression results of VCF inter-annual comparisons (2000-2005) and VCF-Quickbird image-interpreted estimates indicate that: (1) Pixel-level, inter-annual comparisons of VCF estimates of percent canopy cover were linearly related (mean R-2 = 0.77) and exhibited an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.1% and an average root mean square difference (RMSD) of 7.3%. (2) A comparison of image-interpreted percent tree crown cover estimates based on dot counts on Quickbird color images by two different interpreters were more variable (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 14.8%, RMSD = 18.7%) than VCF inter-annual comparisons. (3) Across the circumpolar boreal region, 2005 VCF-Quickbird comparisons were linearly related, with an R-2 = 0.57, a RMSE = 13.4% and a RMSD = 21.3%, with a tendency to over-estimate areas of low percent tree cover and anomalous VCF results in Scandinavia. The relationship of the VCF estimates and ground reference indicate to potential users that the VCFs tree cover values for individual pixels, particularly those below 20% tree cover, may not be precise enough to monitor 500 m pixel-level tree cover in the taiga-tundra transition zone.

In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, illegal logging increased and reforestation on abandoned farmland was widespread after the breakdown of socialism, and the region\'s forest cover trends remain overall largely unclear. Our goal here was to map forest cover change and to assess the extent of illegal logging and reforestation in the Ukrainian Carpathians. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ images and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to derive forest change trajectories between 1988 and 2007 for the entire Ukrainian Carpathians. We calculated logging and reforestation rates, and compared Landsat-based forest trends to official statistics and inventory maps. Our classification resulted in reliable forest/nonforest maps (overall accuracies between 97.1%-98.01%) and high clear cut detection rates (on average 89.4%). Forest cover change was widespread in the Ukrainian Carpathians between 1988 and 2007. We found forest cover increase in peripheral areas, forest loss in the interior Carpathians, and increased logging in remote areas. Overall, our results suggest that unsustainable forest use from socialist times likely persisted in the post-socialist period, resulting in a continued loss of older forests and forest fragmentation. Landsat-based forest trends differed substantially from official forest resource statistics. Illegal logging appears to have been at least as extensive as documented logging during the early 1990s and so-called sanitary clear-cuts represent a major loophole for overharvesting and logging in restricted areas. Reforestation and illegal logging are frequently not accounted for in forest resource statistics, highlighting limitations of these data. Combating illegal logging and transitioning towards sustainable forestry requires better monitoring and up-to-date accounting of forest resources, in the Carpathians and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and remote sensing can be a key technology to achieve these goals.

Diagnostic estimates of primary productivity are obviously error prone when these changes are not accounted for. Additional complications arise when factors inuencing a biome-specific maximum light use efficiency (LUE) must be estimated over a large area. In these cases a direct estimation of ecosystem LUE could reduce uncertainty of GPP estimates. Here, we analyse whether a MODIS-based photochemical reectance index (PRI) is a useful proxy for the light use efficiency of a Mediterranean Quercus ilex forest. As the originally proposed reference band for PRI is not available on MODIS, we tested the reference bands 1 (620-670 nm), 4 (545-565 nm), 12 (546-556 nm), 13 (662-672 nm), and 14 (673-683 nm) using different atmospheric correction algorithms. We repeated the analysis with different temporal resolutions of LUE (half-hourly to daily). The strongest correlation between LUE and PRI was found when considering only a narrow range of viewing angles at a time (especially 0-10 degrees and 30-40 degrees). We found that the MODIS-based PRI was able to track ecosystem LUE even during severe summer time water limitation. For this Mediterranean-type ecosystem we could show that a GPP estimation based on PRI is a huge improvement compared to the MODIS GPP algorithm. In this study, MODIS spectral band 1 turned out to be the most suitable reference band for PRI, followed by the narrow red bands 13 and 14. As to date no universally applicable reference band was identified in MODIS-based PRI studies, we advocate thorough testing for the optimal band combination in future studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, land cover mapping of large areas with medium-resolution imagery is costly and often constrained by the lack of good training and validation data. Our goal was to overcome these limitations, and to test chain classifications, i.e.. the classification of Landsat images based on the information in the overlapping areas of neighboring scenes. The basic idea was to classify one Landsat scene first where good ground truth data is available, and then to classify the neighboring Landsat scene using the land cover classification of the first scene in the overlap area as training data. We tested chain classification for a forest/non-forest classification in the Carpathian Mountains on one horizontal chain of six Landsat scenes, and two vertical chains of two Landsat scenes each. We collected extensive training data from Quickbird imagery for classifying radiometrically uncorrected data with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVMs classified 8 scenes with overall accuracies between 92.1% and 98.9% (average of 96.3%). Accuracy loss when automatically classifying neighboring scenes with chain classification was 1.9% on average. Even a chain of six images resulted only in an accuracy loss of 5.1% for the last image compared to a reference classification from independent training data for the last image. Chain classification thus performed well, but we note that chain classification can only be applied when land cover classes are well represented in the overlap area of neighboring Landsat scenes. As long as this constraint is met though, chain classification is a powerful approach for large area land cover classifications, especially in areas of varying training data availability.

They mainly occur in soils of and and semi-arid regions, which cover more than 35% of the earth\'s land surface and are assumed to play a major role as primary producers, C- and N-sinks and soil stabilizers.   In order to establish a methodology for mapping of BSCs, their spectral characteristics with respect to different crust types were analyzed. The resulting reflectance spectra of different crust types had a shallow absorption feature centered around 680 nm in common, in which they differed from the spectra of bare soil.   In October 2004, hyperspectral CAST data with a spatial resolution of I in were recorded in conjunction with field spectroscopic measurements in the Succulent Karoo, South Africa. Available spectral indices for Biological Soil Crusts were tested on the image but did not produce satisfying classifications. Therefore, an alternative approach was established based on spectral field data, field observations and the hyperspectral dataset. The newly developed Continuum Removal Crust Identification Algorithm (CRCIA) is based on small and narrow spectral characteristics, that were extracted by continuum removal and subsequently expressed as a set of logical conditions. Using this method, 16.2% of the area which covers 12 km(2) of gently sloping hills with some granite outcrops were classified as BSCs. Validation of the classification resulted in a Kappa index of 0.831.   In a next step, the methodology will be tested with regard to scale-dependent effects and applied to images covering areas with additional types of BSCs and soil to develop a robust and generally applicable method.

These data and model output serve as input for the simulator, allowing for the performance of satellite DIAL under highly-inhomogeneous atmospheric conditions including clouds to be assessed. The airborne measurements show an intrusion of stratospheric air into the troposphere, and MM5 data used above the DLR Falcon airplane flight altitude are characterized by very high upper tropospheric humidity levels, comparable to those associated with strong mid-latitude transport events from the troposphere to the lowermost stratosphere. Results of the simulator reveal that the maximum systematic error does not exceed 5% up to 16 km, except in the presence of thick cirrus and mid level clouds with an optical thickness up to 2 and, occasionally, inside the dry stratospheric intrusion, while the random error is less than 20% up to 16 km when spatial measurement resolutions are applied that follow the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) threshold observational requirements for numerical weather prediction (NWP). The bias is even smaller if a drier upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) region from a reference atmosphere is considered. The results confirm the capability of satellite water vapour DIAL systems to retrieve thin structures of the tropospheric water vapour and particle backscatter fields, as well as its capability to provide low bias and random error measurements even in the presence of clouds.

These numerical models, driven by the boundary conditions in the atmosphere and in the soil, require adequate knowledge of those vegetation and soil characteristics which are determinant in the characterisation of mass and energy transfers. In view of the fact that, firstly this information is often only partially known, and secondly the transfers are sometimes incorrectly represented, these models can rapidly drift and need to be regularly corrected. To this aim, remote sensing is a promising tool and many studies are currently devoted to the development of assimilation techniques to control their inputs or internal variables. The research presented in this paper contributes to this effort. Its ambition is to explore new methodologies, designed to make use of remote sensing thermal infrared data recorded from space. This study is based on the analysis of links between the characteristics of the diurnal cycle of the surface brightness temperature and the soil-atmosphere interface parameters and variables. The proposed methodology takes advantage of these temperatures cycling features, instead of absolute temperature values, to calibrate the LSM. The results show that the model parameters have a significant impact on the diurnal temperature dynamics, sometimes to a greater extent than on the temperature itself, and that these relationships have diurnal and seasonal variations. As a consequence, the use of TIR data for LSM calibration can be optimised by considering only those parts of the information which are really relevant to parameter calibration.

The ANN algorithm showed good performance across different vegetation types, with high correlations and consistent determination coefficients. The approach outperformed a multiple linear regression approach used to independently retrieve the same variable. The calibrated algorithm was then applied at the MODIS 500 m scale to follow changes in CWC for the year 2005 across the continental United States, subdivided into three vegetation types (grassland, shrubland, and forest). The ANN estimates of CWC correlated well with rainfall, indicating a strong ecological response.

A major difference between the two models is whether the soil and vegetation components of the scene are treated separately (Two-Source Energy Balance; TSEB approach) or as a lumped composite (one-source approach; Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land; SEBAL) in the parameterization of radiative and turbulent exchanges with the overlying air. Comparisons are performed using data from two largescale field experiments covering sub-humid grassland (Southern Great Plains \'97) and semi-arid rangeland (Monsoon \'90) having very different landscape properties. In general, there was reasonable agreement between flux output from both models versus a handful of flux tower observations. However, spatial intercomparisons of model output over the full modeling domains yielded relatively large discrepancies (on the order of 100 W m(-2)) in sensible heat flux (H) that are related to land cover. In particular, bare soil and sparsely vegetated areas yielded the largest discrepancies, with TSEB fluxes being in better agreement with tower observations. Modifications to SEBAL inputs that reduced discrepancies with TSEB and observations for bare soil and shrub classes tended to increase differences for other land cover classes. In particular, improvements to SEBAL inputs of surface roughness for momentum tended to exacerbate errors with respect to observed fluxes. These results suggest that some of the simplifying assumptions in SEBAL may not be strictly applicable over the wide range in conditions present within these landscapes. An analysis of TSEB and SEBAL sensitivity to uncertainties in primary inputs indicated that errors in surface temperature or surface-air temperature differences had the greatest impact on H estimates. Inputs of secondary importance were fractional vegetation cover for TSEB, while for SEBAL, the selection of pixels representing wet and dry moisture end-member conditions significantly influenced flux predictions. The models were also run using input fields derived from both local and remote data sources, to test performance under conditions of varying ancillary data availability. In this case, both models performed similarly under both constraints. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Int Inst Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observ, NL-7500 AA Enschede, Netherlands.

In the southeastern United States, where most fires are small and relatively cool, the MODIS version 4 contextual algorithm can be adjusted and improved for more accurate regional fire detection. Based on the MODIS version 4 contextual algorithm and a smoke detection algorithm, an improved algorithm using four TIR channels and seven solar reflectance channels is described.

The study reveals that the T-22 of most small, cool fires undetected by the MODIS version 4 contextual algorithm is lower than 310 K.

The Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project (SWReGAP) was the first formal GAP project designed at a regional, multi-state scale. The project area comprises the southwestern states of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. The land-cover map/dataset was generated using regionally consistent geospatial data (Landsat ETM+ imagery (1999-2001) and DEM derivatives), similar field data collection protocols, a standardized land-cover legend, and a common modeling approach (decision tree classifier). Partitioning of mapping responsibilities amongst the five collaborating states was organized around ecoregion-based \"mapping zones\". Over the course of 2(1)/(2) field seasons approximately 93,000 reference samples were collected directly, or obtained from other contemporary projects, for the land-cover modeling effort. The final map was made public in 2004 and contains 125 land-cover classes. An internal validation of 85 of the classes, representing 91% of the land area was performed. Agreement between withheld samples and the validated dataset was 61% (KHAT=.60, n = 17,030). This paper presents an overview of the methodologies used to create the regional land-cover dataset and highlights issues associated with large-area mapping within a coordinated, multi-institutional management framework.

Previously, the spatial, temporal, and source characteristics of aerosols over the Mojave Desert have been examined using in situ observations; however, in situ observations lack spatial coverage, and the only long-term measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) needed for aerosol impact studies on the local climate and biota is the AERONET site at Rogers Dry Lake. In this study, we provide the first moderately high spatial resolution (17.6 x 17.6 km(2)) study of AOD over the Mojave Desert of southern California using satellite data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) for the period of March 2000 to October 2005. We have demonstrated the seasonality of AOD over the entire Mojave Desert, and the spatial and temporal variability of AOD from the average AOD at national parks, military installations, and dry lakes and playas. Statistically significant differences from the Mojave Desert mean AOD can be attributed to proximity to urban sources (e.g., Rogers Dry Lake is near the Los Angeles metropolitan area) and local sources (e.g., mineral extraction at Bristol Dry Lake). The western Mojave, generally around Rogers Dry Lake and Harper Dry Lake exhibited the most sustained pattern of seasonally high aerosol optical depths throughout the year. As a result, the AERONET site at Rogers Dry Lake should not be used as a site representative of the aerosol conditions over the entire Mojave Desert of southern California. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We are refining this system and assembling a statistical database, aimed at understanding how injection height relates to the fire severity and local weather conditions. In this paper we focus on our working proof-of-concept system that demonstrates how machine-leaming and data mining methods aid in processing of massive volumes of satellite data.

These lakes form the backbone of the habitat that supports the highly diverse flora and fauna of the Pantanal, yet the natural processes that create and destroy them are largely unknown. The quantities and types of lakes in the Pantanal and their spatial distribution are therefore essential, but missing information required to understand the dynamics of the Pantanal ecosystem. RADARSAT S I and S7, and JERS-1 imagery were integrated with field measurements of water geochemistry and characteristics of emergent aquatic vegetation for fresh and brackish lakes of the Nhecolandia region of the Brazilian Pantanal. A supervised classification was used to classify forest, pasture, bare soil, and lakes. A mask is then applied to produce an image of only lakes. The radar backscattering values were found to have a strong relationship with the emergent aquatic plant assemblages of the lakes-S1 imagery was the most useful. The plant assemblages, in turn, were observed to be strongly controlled by the total dissolved solids (TDS) and pH of the lakes. The relationships between backscattering values, plant assemblages, and geochemistry were then exploited to map the type and distribution of the lakes in the study area. Threshold rules were used to perform Level I and Level 2 classifications of the lakes. For the Level I classification, the go values of RADARSAT SI effectively separated brackish (10,000 > TDS > 1000 mg/kg) from fresh water lakes (TDS < 1000 mg/kg) with a total accuracy of 91%. For the Level 2 classification, the go values of RADARSAT SI effectively separated lakes into three geochemical groups: brackish (10,000 > TDS > 1000 mg/kg), hard with only Typha (1000 > TDS > 100 mg/kg), and fresh water lakes (TDS mg/kg < 100 mg/kg) with a total accuracy of 83%. Considering that the area is very remote and the lakes are very numerous, this may be the most feasible way to map lake type in the Pantanal. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Results indicate the beta-test product tracks the general seasonal variability in albedo but exhibits significant more temporal variability than observed at the stations. This may indicate problems with the cloud detection algorithm, and/or failure of the BRDF model to adequately model the bidirectional reflectance of snow. Comparisons with in situ observations at five automatic weather stations in Greenland indicate an overall RMSE of 0.067 for the Terra instrument and an RMSE of 0.075 on Aqua. The Terra-retrieved-albedo are slightly better correlated with the in situ data than the Aqua retrievals (r=0.79 versus r=0.77). Comparisons were also made between the MODIS daily albedo product and the MODIS 16-day albedo product (MOD43133). Results indicate general correspondence between the two products, with better agreement found using the Terra-retrieved-albedo than the Aqua-retrieved albedo. The reason for the differences in albedo between the Aqua and Terra satellites remains unclear. At the stations examined, both the Terra and Aqua retrievals were made at nearly the same time of the day and therefore the differences in albedo between the satellites cannot be explained by differences in solar illumination. Finally, the albedo derived using MODIS data and the direct estimation algorithm (DEA) was also compared with 2004 Greenland in situ data. Results from this comparison suggest that the DEA performs well as long as the solar zenith angle of the observation is not greater than 70 degrees. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The flux of greenhouse gases in and out of these forests is influenced strongly by disturbances such as diseases, logging and predominantly fire. It is important to quantify these disturbances to enable the modelling of major greenhouse gases. However, because of the remoteness and vastness of the boreal forest, little data is available on the type, extent, frequency and severity of these disturbances in Siberia. For burnt areas, two of the more responsive wavelengths are the short wave infra-red (SWIR) and the near infra-red (NIR). These produce a vegetation index, the normalised difference SWIR (NDSWIR) capable of detecting retrospective disturbances. Here we combine the NDSWIR from MODIS imagery acquired in the summer of 2003 with thermal anomaly data from 1992 to 2003 to detect and date areas which burnt at some point between 1992 and 2003. The semi-automated method is called SWIR and Thermal ANomalies for Detecting Disturbances (STANDD) and is complemented by an Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) differencing method using MODIS 2002 and 2003 imagery to ensure reliable detection of area burnt in the year of image acquisition (i.e. 2003).

The Brady-Desert Peak geothermal fields are located about 80 km east of Reno, Nevada in the Hot Springs Mountains. North-northeast-striking en-echelon faults offset Tertiary volcanic and lacustrine rocks. Two geothermal power plants produce electricity from two separate geothermal systems, one with numerous fumaroles and mudpots, the other showing no active surface expression of geothermal activity. Surface occurrences of gypsum, calcium-carbonate, hematite, and opaline silica were identified at both sites with the hyperspectral data; these minerals when considered together are indicative of geothermal activity at both sites. Mapping results were synthesized with other spatial data in a geographic information systems (GIS) database that was used to help draw structural interpretations of faulting and fault controls at the Brady-Desert Peak area.

Recent studies have successfully estimated net radiation (R-n) over large heterogeneous areas for clear sky days using only remote sensing observations. With distributed maps of EF and R-n, it is now possible to explore the feasibility and robustness of ET estimation from multiple satellites. Here we present the results of an extensive inter-comparison of spatially distributed ET and related variables (NDVI, T-o, EF and R-n) derived from MODIS and AVHRR sensors onboard EOS Terra, NOAA14 and NOAA16 satellites respectively. Our results show that although, NDVI and T. differ with the sensor response functions and overpass times, contextual space of NDVI-T-o diagram gives comparable estimates of EF. The utility of different sensors is demonstrated by 2 validating the estimated ET results to ground flux stations over the Southern Great Plains with a root mean square error of 53, 51 and 56.24 Wm(-2), and a correlation of 0.84, 0.79 and 0.77 from MODIS, NOAA16 and NOAA14 sensors respectively.

However, this subtle wavelength shift is difficult to measure accurately using unmixing and matching algorithms that rely on spectral end members, because the wavelength position is uncorrelated to the general shape of the reflectance spectra of white micas. An alternative method is presented that uses pixel-dependent information only and that is based on extracting diagnostic spectral information of the mineral of interest through band ratios. Multiple regression analysis is then used to determine the relation between band ratios calculated from airborne imaging spectroscopy and the absorption wavelength of white micas measured in rock samples on the ground. The complicating effects of vegetation mixing with mineral signatures at the pixel level are addressed through a combination of band ratios that target the respective diagnostic absorptions. With this method the presence of white micas at the earth surface is estimated from two band ratios,L2168 nm/L2185 nm and L2005 nm/Lm2079nm, where band ratio L2005 nm/ L2079nm is proportional to the abundance of cellulose in spinifex vegetation. The absorption wavelength of white micas is then estimated from the two band ratios L2220 nm/L2202nm and L2237 nm/ L2220nm. The results of both band-ratio regression analyses can then be combined to show predicted wavelengths of white mica in the areas of highest probability of containing white mica.

For Chl between 0.1 and 10 mg m(-3), both SeaWiFS and MODIS agreed well with in situ data. Errors for turbid coastal waters were larger than for offshore waters but the overall RMS (root mean square) error in log scale was within 0.35. The percentage RMS error was much larger, varying between 60% and 170% for open ocean and most of the shallow (< 30 m), coastal regions. However, there was no large systematic error or significant bias in either satellite data set, and these numbers were comparable to those for other global oceans and not significantly larger than the algorithm \"noise\" (0.22 in RMS error in log scale). Further, SeaWiFS and MODIS showed similar spatial and temporal patterns between July 2002 and October 2004, as well as nearly identical concentrations for Chl between 0.1 and 4 mg m(-3). RMS difference between the two data sets of monthly mean Chl for several sub-regions was generally < 11% and < 0.05 (after logarithmic transformation). For each individual month, the statistics (mean, mode, median) of the two data sets for the entire study region (6-9 x 10(5) satellite pixels at similar to 1 km resolution) were very similar, with RMS differences typically between 30% and 40% and between 0.10 and 0.15 (after logarithmic transformation), where no significant bias was found. Therefore, it would be possible to continue the time series using only one sensor such as MODIS, in the eventual absence of SeaWiFS. Further research is needed to improve the remote sensing algorithms for application in turbid coastal waters. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The simulation was carried out for three different water types: (I) CDOM-rich coastal water, (2) coastal waters not directly impacted by high CDOM discharge from rivers but with high concentration of cyanobacteria, (3) open Baltic waters. Our modelling results indicate that the reflectance spectra of C. glomerata, F. lumhricalis, F. vesiculosus differ from each other and also from sand and deep water reflectance spectra. The differences are detectable by remote sensing instruments at spectral resolution of 10 nm and SNR better than 1000:1. Thus, the lowest depth limits where the studied macroalgae grow do not exceed the depth where such remote sensing instruments could potentially detect the spectral differences between the studied species.

However, none of the retrackers are intended to the processing of the radar echoes over continental waters.

We have selected four test-zones over the Amazon basin to achieve this validation study. We compare first the performances of these retracking algorithms to deliver reliable water levels for land hydrology. Comparisons with in-situ gauge stations showed that Ice-1 algorithm, based on the Offset Centre of Gravity technique, provides the more accurate water stages.

Nighttime ASTER kinetic temperature measurements were found to be a good analogue for nighttime surface temperatures. Linear regression between ASTER and buoy-measured temperatures in a test lake were better during the evening (R-2=0.98) than the day (R-2=0.90), presumably due to the greater influence of radiation and latent heat fluxes during daylight hours. Nighttime lake surface temperatures measured in three ASTER scenes were significantly correlated to logarithm of lake area, maximum lake depth, Secchi depth (a measure of lake clarity) and lake order (a measure of lake connection with surface drainage), during October and November. Nighttime lake surface temperatures were significantly correlated only With lake area in July. We hypothesize that morphology was more strongly related to surface temperature in the fall months due to lake turnover during that season. This study suggests that satellite derived thermal data may be useful for calculation of lake heat budgets and evaporation rates, provided surface temperatures are measured in well-mixed lakes.

The irradiance reflectance model is implemented with three-component inherent optical property submodels.   In this parameterization scheme, an unsupervised classification was applied in the hyper-spectral space of reflectance, leading to three spectrally distinct optical water types. The reflectance model was parameterized for the entire data set, and then parameterized for each of the water types. The three sets of type-specific model parameters, which define corresponding IOP submodels, are believed to accommodate differences in the optical properties of the in-water constituents. The parameterized reflectance model was evaluated by both reconstructing measured reflectance spectra and solving for the nonlinear inverse problem to retrieve in-water constituent concentrations. The model accuracy was significantly improved in the forward direction for classified waters over that of non-classified waters, but no significant improvement was achieved in the retrieval accuracy (inverse direction).

Fire is a major cause of surface change and occurs in most vegetation zones across the world. The identification and delineation of fire-affected areas, also known as burned areas or fire scars, may be considered a change detection problem. Remote sensing algorithms developed to map fire-affected areas are difficult to implement reliably over large areas because of variations in both the surface state and those imposed by the sensing system. The availability of robustly calibrated, atmospherically corrected, cloud-screened, geolocated data provided by the latest generation of moderate resolution remote sensing systems allows for major advances in satellite mapping of fire-affected area. This paper describes an algorithm developed to map fire-affected areas at a global scale using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance time series data. The algorithm is developed from the recently published Bi-Directional Reflectance Model-Based Expectation change detection approach and maps at 500 in the location and approximate day of burning. Improvements made to the algorithm for systematic global implementation are presented and the algorithm performance is demonstrated for southern African, Australian, South American, and Boreal fire regimes. The algorithm does not use training data but rather applies a wavelength independent threshold and spectral constraints defined by the noise characteristics of the reflectance data and knowledge of the spectral behavior of burned vegetation and spectrally confusing changes that are not associated with burning. Temporal constraints are applied capitalizing on the spectral persistence of fire-affected areas. Differences between mapped fire-affected areas and cumulative MODIS active fire detections are illustrated and discussed for each fire regime. The results reveal a coherent spatio-temporal mapping of fire-affected area and indicate that the algorithm shows potential for global application. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Monthly NDVI fields exhibit power law Fourier spectra, E(k)=ck(-beta), with k denoting the wavenumber, c the prefactor, and the scaling exponent. Fourier spectra exhibit two scaling regimes separated at approximately 29 km, above which NDVI exhibit long-range spatial correlations (0<beta<2),. and below which NDVI behaves like white noise in space (betasimilar or equal to0). Series of monthly values of c(t) and beta(t) exhibit high negative correlation (-0.88, P>0.99), which suggest their linkages in power laws, but also that E-t(k)=c(t)k(-beta(t)), with t the time index. Results show a significant negative simultaneous correlation (-0.82, P>0.95) between monthly series of average precipitation over the Amazon, (P(t)), and scaling exponents, beta(t); and high positive lagged correlation (0.63, P>0.95), between (P(t)) and (NDVI(t+3)). Parameters also reflect the hydrological seasonal cycle over Amazonia: during the wet season (November-March), beta(t) ranges between 0.9 and 1.15, while during the dry season (May-September), beta(t)similar or equal to1.30. These results reflect the more (less) coherent spatial effect of the dry (wet) season over Amazonia, which translates into longer (shorter)-range spatial correlations of the NDVI field, as witnessed by higher (lower) values of beta(t). At interannual timescales, both phases of ENSO reflect on both parameters, as beta(t) is higher during El Nino than during La Nina, due to the more coherent effects of El Nino-related dryness, whereas NDVI spatial variability is enhanced during La Nina, due to positive rainfall anomalies. Results from the moment-scale analysis indicate the existence of multi-scaling in the spatial variability of NDVI fields. Departures front single scaling exhibit also annual and interannual variability, which consistently reflect the effects from both phases of ENSO. Furthermore, departures from single scaling are independent of the order moment, q, as the PDF of departures scaled by the mean collapse to a unique distribution. These results point out that ideas of spatial scaling constitute a promising framework to synthesize important hydro-ecological processes of Arnazonia. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The spatial distribution of green leaf area index, direct-beam and difftise solar radiation and air humidity was inferred on the basis of late morning MODIS data that was combined with afternoon AVHRR data to resolve the diurnal variation in air and surface temperature. These variables were used in a coupled \"two-leaf\' ecosystem model operating at an hourly time scale.   The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was strongly correlated with field measurements of green leaf area index (r(2)=0.91) and remained sensitive to variations in green biomass up to green leaf area indices of 4-5. Evaluation against standard meteorological data showed that instantaneous estimates of air temperature, actual vapor pressure and incoming solar radiation could be retrieved with overall root mean square errors of 2.5 degreesC, 138.3 Pa and 47.7 W m(-2), respectively. The combination of late morning and afternoon inferences made it possible to resolve the diurnal course in key model parameters, and predicted rates of ecosystem CO2 and water vapor exchange were comparable to eddy covariance measurements at a single flux tower. A large spatial diversity in CO2 and water vapor exchange was maintained throughout the study period due to significant regional variations in meteorological input variables and large spatial differences in canopy development. The results of this study stress the necessity of pixel based estimates for an accurate evaluation of regional budgets Of CO2 and water vapor exchange. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

An image segmentation procedure aided the removal of pixels representative of residual forest and other noncharacteristic stand conditions within forest inventory polygons, in order to isolate the pixels representative of regenerating harvested forest. A stepwise multivariate regression procedure was used to estimate stand age for harvested areas, and an R-2 of 0.68 (with a standard error of less than 2.4 years) was computed. This transferable approach provides useful information for forest C accounting when the year of disturbance, or the age of subsequent regeneration, is required for estimating C stocks.

Within the European project Heliosat-3, a new type of solar irradiance scheme is developed. This new type will be based on radiative transfer models (RTM) using atmospheric parameter information retrieved from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite (Clouds, ozone, water vapour) and the ERS-2/ENVISAT satellites (aerosols, ozone).   This paper focuses on the description of the clear-sky module of the new scheme, especially on the integrated use of a radiative transfer model. The linkage of the clear-sky module with the cloud module is also briefly described in order to point out the benefits of the integrated RTM use for the all-sky situations. The integrated rise of an RTM within the new Solar Irradiance Scheme SOLIS is applied by introducing a new fitting function called the modified Lambert-Beer (MLB) relation. Consequently, the modified Lambert-Beer relation and its role for an integrated RTM use are discussed. Comparisons of the calculated clear-sky irradiances with ground-based measurements and the current clear-sky module demonstrate the advantages and benefits of SOLIS. Since SOLIS can provide spectrally resolved irradiance data, it can be used for different applications. Beside improved information for the planning of solar energy systems, the calculation of photosynthetic active radiation, UV index, and illuminance is possible. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The clumping index causes a reduction in the interception of radiation by the canopy at a fixed leaf area index (LAI). In this study, we show how within-shoot multiple scattering is related to shoot scale clumping and derive a similar, but wavelength dependent, correction to the scattering coefficient. The results provide a method for integrating shoot structure into current radiative transfer equation based forest reflectance models. The method was applied to explore the effect of shoot scale clumping on canopy spectral reflectance using simple model canopies with a homogeneous higher level structure. The clumping of needles into shoots caused a wavelength dependent reduction in canopy reflectance, as compared to that of a leaf canopy with similar interception. This is proposed to be one reason why coniferous and broad-leaved canopies occupy different regions in the spectral space and exhibit different dependency of spectral vegetation indices on LAI.

The forest degradation map was produced in two steps. First, we investigated the relationship between ground (i.e., field and IKONOS data) and satellite scales by analyzing statistics and performing visual analyses of the field classes in terms of fraction values. This procedure allowed us to define four classes of forest at the SPOT 4 image scale, which included: intact forest; logged forest (recent and older logged forests in the field); degraded forest (heavily burned, heavily logged and burned forests in the field); and regeneration (old heavily logged and old heavily burned forest in the field). Next, we used a decision tree classifier (DTC) to define a set of rules to separate the forest classes using the fraction images. We classified 35% of the forest area (2097.3 km(2)) as intact forest. Logged forest accounted for 56% of the forest area and 9% of the forest area was classified as degraded forest. The resultant forest degradation map showed good agreement (86% overall accuracy) with areas of degraded forest visually interpreted from two IKONOS images.

Many ecologically and biogeochemically important landscape features are spatially extensive, but occur at scales much smaller than the similar to1-km footprint of wide-swath, polar orbiting radiometers. This is especially true for land cover changes associated with human activities. Satellite instruments that offer the appropriate spatial detail have much smaller swaths and longer repeat times, resulting in compositing intervals that are too large to resolve the time scales of these changes. In addition, the cost and effort associated with acquisition and processing of high-resolution data for large areas is often prohibitive. Methods for taking advantage of information contained in multiple-scale observations by combining data from high-resolution and moderate resolution sensors are thus of great current interest.   In this paper, we retrieve land cover distributions in two different parts of the Brazilian Amazon region by estimating relationships between land cover fractions derived from 30-m resolution ETM+ and reflectance data from similar to1-km resolution MODIS and MISR. The scaling relationships are derived using a Bayesian-regularized artificial neural network (ANN) and compared to results using linear unmixing (LU). We explore the simultaneous use of two significant independent variables in terrestrial optical remote sensing, wavelength, and sun-sensor geometry, by combining nadir-adjusted MODIS reflectances in seven bands (VIS-SWIR) with multiangular (-71degrees to +71degrees) bidirectional reflectance data from MISR. This research was motivated by evidence from modeling and field studies demonstrating that: (a) the angular dependence of reflectance (e.g., from MISR) contains information about the structural composition of canopies that is complementary to the wavelength dependence; and (b) the SWIR portion of the spectrum (e.g., from MODIS) is sensitive to canopy moisture and shading conditions and, therefore, to the successional status of the ecosystem. This case study, using the Bayesian artificial neural network with combined MODIS-MISR data to estimate sub-pixel land cover fractions, yielded a quantitative improvement over spectral linear unmixing of single-angle, multispectral data. Our results suggest potential for broad-scale applicability despite a number of challenges related to tropical atmospheric conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The investigation is based on a 72-year time series data set compiled from interpreted historical aerial photography and from IKONOS satellite imagery. Spatial metrics were used both specifically to assess the impact of urban development in four administrative districts, and generally to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban growth. The metrics quantify the temporal and spatial properties of urban development, and show definitively the impacts of growth constraints imposed on expansion by topography and by local planning efforts. The SLEUTH urban growth and land use change model was calibrated using the multi-temporal data sets for the entire study region. The calibrated model allowed us to fill gaps in the discontinuous historical time series of urban spatial extent, since maps and images were available only for selected years between 1930 and 2001. The model also allowed a spatial forecast of urban growth to the year 2030. The spatial metrics provided a detailed description of the accuracy of the model\'s historical simulations that applied also to forecasts of future development. The results illustrate the utility of modeling in explaining the amount and spatial pattern of urban growth. Even using modeling, however, the forecasting of urban development remains problematic and could benefit from further research on spatial metrics and their incorporation into the model calibration process. The combined approach using remote sensing, spatial metrics and urban modeling is powerful, and may prove a productive new direction for the improved understanding, representation and modeling of the spatiotemporal forms due to the process of urbanization.

[International Journal of Remote Sensing 10 (1989) 1699]. The review demonstrates that while some progress has been made, the thermal remote sensing of urban areas has been slow to advance beyond qualitative description of thermal patterns and simple correlations. Part of the difficulty lies in the tendency to use qualitatively based land use data to describe the urban surface rather than the use of more fundamental surface descriptors. Advances in the application of thermal remote sensing to natural and agricultural surfaces suggest insight into possible methods to advance techniques and capabilities over urban areas. Improvements in the spatial and spectral resolution of current and next-generation satellite-based sensors, in more detailed surface representations of urban surfaces and in the availability of low cost, high resolution portable thermal scanners are expected to allow progress in the application of urban thermal remote sensing to the study of the climate of urban areas.

Determination of the emitted radiant energy released during biomass combustion episodes (the so-called fire radiative energy or FRE) has been suggested as a new tool for determining variations in biomass combustion rates and the rate of production of atmospheric pollutants. We review the physical principals behind the remote determination of FRE and present an alternative method for its derivation via analysis of \'fire pixel\' radiances in the middle infrared spectral region. We compare our method to the existing FRE retrieval approach used in the EOS Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) fire products, and to retrievals of FRE based on derived fire temperature and area made via the so-called Bi-spectral method. We test each FRE retrieval method using both simulated data and imagery from a new experimental space mission, the Bi-spectral InfraRed Detection (BIRD) small satellite, which has sensors specifically designed for the study of active fires. We analyse near simultaneous MODIS and BIRD data of the fires that burned around Sydney, Australia in January 2002. Despite the markedly different pixel size and spectral coverage of these sensors, where the spatial extent of the fire pixel groups detected by MODIS and BIRD are similar, the derived values of FRE for these fires agree to within +/- 15%. However, in certain fires, the lower spatial resolution of MODIS appears to prevent many of the less intensely radiating fire pixels being detected as such, meaning MODIS underestimates FRE for these fires by up to 46% in comparison to BIRD. Though the FRE release of each of these low intensity fire pixels is relatively low, their comparatively large number makes their overall FRE significant. Thus, total FRE release of the Sydney fires on 5 January 2002 is estimated to be 6.5 x 10(9) J s(-1) via BIRD but 4.0 x 10(9) J s(-1) via MODIS. The ability of BIRD to resolve individual fire fronts further allows the first accurate calculation of \'radiative\' fireline intensity from spaceborne measurements, providing values of 15-75 kJ s(-1) m(-1) for fire fronts that are up to 9 kin in length. Finally, we analyse the effectiveness of the satellite-based FRE retrieval methods in estimating the FRE from the active flaming and smouldering components only (FREActive, believed to be proportional to the rate of biomass combustion), despite the sensor receiving additional radiance from the \'cooling ground\'. The MIR radiance method appears particularly strong in this regard, allowing FREActive to be estimated to within +/- 30% in the range 100-100,000 J s(-1) m(-2). These results provide further confidence in the ability of spacebome missions to derive physically meaningful values of FRE that could be used to support biomass burning emissions inventories. Future comparisons between FRE derived via MODIS and those from higher spatial resolution BIRD or airborne imagery may allow the MODIS-derived FRE values to be \'calibrated\' for any systematic underestimation. We therefore expect FRE to become an important tool for enhancing global studies of terrestrial vegetation fires with infrared remote sensing, particularly as the majority of large fires are now imaged four times per day via the MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft.

The analysis covers three themes. First, the assumption of wavelength independence of spectral invariants of transport equation, central to the parameterization of the MODIS LAI and FPAR algorithm, is evaluated. The physical interpretation of those parameters is given and an approach to minimize the uncertainties in its retrievals is proposed. Second, the theoretical basis of the algorithm was refined by introducing stochastic concepts which account for the effect of foliage clumping and discontinuities on LAI retrievals.

The global extent of primary salt-affected soils is about 955 M ha, while secondary salinization affects some 77 M ha, with 58% of these in irrigated areas. Nearly 20% of all irrigated land is salt-affected, and this proportion tends to increase in spite of considerable efforts dedicated to land reclamation. This requires careful monitoring of the soil salinity status and variation to curb degradation trends, and secure sustainable land use and management. Multitemporal optical and microwave remote sensing can significantly contribute to detecting temporal changes of salt-related surface features. Airborne geophysics and ground-based electromagnetic induction meters, combined with ground data, have shown potential for mapping depth of salinity occurrence. This paper reviews various sensors (e.g. aerial photographs, satellite- and airborne multispectral sensors, microwave sensors, video imagery, airborne geophysics, hyperspectral sensors, and electromagnetic induction meters) and approaches used for remote identification and mapping of salt-affected areas. Constraints on the use of remote sensing data for mapping salt-affected areas are shown related to the spectral behaviour of salt types, spatial distribution of salts on the terrain surface, temporal changes on salinity, interference of vegetation, and spectral confusions with other terrain surfaces.   As raw remote sensing data need substantial transformation for proper feature recognition and mapping, techniques such as spectral unmixing, maximum likelihood classification, fuzzy classification, band ratioing, principal components analysis, and correlation equations are discussed. Lastly, the paper presents modelling of temporal and spatial changes of salinity using combined approaches that incorporate different data fusion and data integration techniques.

Topography calculated from TOPSAR data are in the form of a high-resolution (5-mi spatial grid) digital elevation model (DEM). In this study, we focus upon the large, steep fault scarps that cut alluvium and alluvial fans, in Fish Lake Valley, east of the White Mountains of Nevada- California. A series of topographic profiles extracted from the DEM reveal that the larger fault scarps are greater than 40 in in height and that the average midsection slope angle for all measured scarps is approximately 23degrees. These large scarps are the product of multiple offsets rather than a single event. Other relevant geomorphic features present in the digital topography include splays and benches along the main fault, levees, cutbanks, gullies incising fault scarp slopes, shutterridges, offset drainage, and small normal faults with scarp heights of only 4-6 m. Field work corroborated general geomorphologic landforms, confirmed fault-scarp morphometry, and aided the evaluation of the accuracy of the DEM. We are also able to assess fault segmentation models that divide the Fish Lake Valley fault zone (FLVFZ) into discrete segments based upon surface-rupture characteristics.

This map will be used in validating the 500-m global MODIS tree cover product. The map was made at the 30-m Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) resolution and also scaled up to 250- and 500-m resolutions. Five IKONOS images were classified into crown cover/no crown cover maps at 4-m resolution. These maps were aggregated to 30 m to create a continuous training data set of percent crown cover. Three dates of ETM+ data were acquired to predict percent crown cover using a regression tree algorithm. Comparisons of training accuracies and field data to ETM+ tree estimates yielded root mean square errors (rinse) of similar to +/- 10% crown cover. When aggregating the 30-m map to 250- and 500-m MODIS cell sizes, the training errors are more than halved. The final 250-m map was assessed using a structural vegetation map of the area and an overall rmse of 8.5% is estimated. The 250-m map was sampled and used to derive a tree cover continuous field product using 3 Level 113 MODIS time slices, approximating the acquisitions of the ETM+ data. The results are promising as an overall root mean square error between the ETM+ derived tree crown cover map and an aggregated MODIS 500-m map was 5.2%. Results from this test in Zambia show that the MODIS 250-m bands should allow for improved depictions of percent tree cover. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Landsat data provide extensive coverage of generalized forest structural classes in the horizontal plane but are relatively insensitive to variation in forest canopy height. It would, therefore, be desirable to integrate lidar and Landsat data to improve the measurement, mapping, and monitoring of forest structural attributes. We tested five aspatial and spatial methods for predicting canopy height, using an airborne lidar system (Aeroscan) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data: regression, kriging, cokriging, and kriging and cokriging of regression residuals. Our 200-km(2) study area in western Oregon encompassed Oregon State University\'s McDonald-Dunn Research Forest, which is broadly representative of the age and structural classes common in the region. We sampled a spatially continuous lidar coverage in eight systematic patterns to determine which lidar sampling strategy would optimize lidar-Landsat integration in western Oregon forests: transects sampled at 2000, 1000, 500, and 250 m frequencies, and points sampled at these same spatial frequencies. The aspatial regression model results, regardless of sampling strategy, preserved actual vegetation pattern, but underestimated taller canopies and overestimated shorter canopies. The spatial models, kriging and cokriging, produced less biased results than regression but poorly reproduced vegetation pattern, especially at the sparser (2000 and 1000 m) sampling frequencies. The spatial model predictions were more accurate than the regression model predictions at locations < 200 m from sample locations. Cokriging, using the ETM+ panchromatic band as the secondary variable, proved slightly more accurate than kriging. The integrated models that kriged or cokriged regression residuals were preferable to either the aspatial or spatial models alone because they preserved the vegetation pattern like regression yet improved estimation accuracies above those predicted from the regression models alone. The 250-m point sampling strategy proved most optimal because it oversampled the landscape relative to the geostatistical range of actual spatial variation, as indicated by the sample semivariograms, while making the sample data volume more manageable. We concluded that an integrated modeling strategy is most suitable for estimating and mapping canopy height at locations unsampled by lidar, and that a 250-m discrete point sampling strategy most efficiently samples an intensively managed forested landscape in western Oregon.

Its large field of view results in a strong dependency of surface reflectances on the Sun-target-sensor geometry. Our objective is to define a method to remove this anisotropy during the processing of 10-day syntheses derived from data acquired at every VEGETATION orbit pass. This article investigates the concepts that were developed for AVHRR/NOAA, POLDER/ADEOS, and MODIS/ TERRA. The investigation is based on the statistical analysis of 18,000 simulated time series of red and near infrared reflectances, close to the ones acquired on various land classes by the VEGETATION sensor under different geometric, cloudiness, and atmospheric conditions. Conclusions are reached on the successive key stages that are required for the removal of surface reflectance anisotropy during the processing of syntheses. Firstly, we suggest to separate the time window devoted to the retrieval of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) from a second one (shorter) that is used for combining the most recent observations. Secondly, we verify the robustness of the Roujean\'s BRDF model through various angular sampling, land classes, cloudiness, and atmospheric noise. Thirdly, we improve the stability of the formula that normalises reflectances at nadir views. Fourthly, we show that a simple averaging is relevant to combine the observations after normalisation. The comparison with the common Maximum Value Compositing (MVC) method shows that the normalisation of directional effects greatly improves both consistency and accuracy in time series of surface reflectances. Despite the use of two time windows that allows to increase the efficiency of BRDF retrieval, anisotropy removal is still not possible in many cloudy regions of the world. The associated Part II article exposes a method that is fully operational on a 10-day basis under high cloudiness conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Precise calibration was considered to be critical to the success of the Landsat 7 mission and, thus, issues of calibration were given high priority during the development of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Data sets from the Landsat 5 TM are not routinely corrected for a number of radiometric and geometric artifacts, including memory effect, gain/bias, and interfocal plane misalignment. In the current investigation, the effects of correcting vs. not correcting these factors were investigated for several applications. Gain/bias calibrations were found to have a greater impact on most applications than did memory effect calibrations. Correcting interfocal plane offsets was found to have a moderate effect on applications. On June 2, 1999, Landsats 5 and 7 data were acquired nearly simultaneously over a study site in the Niobrara, NE area. Field radiometer data acquired at that site were used to facilitate crosscalibrations of Landsats 5 and 7 data. Current findings and results from previous investigations indicate that the internal calibrator of Landsat 5 TM tracked instrument gain well until 1988. After this, the internal calibrator diverged from the data derived from vicarious calibrations. Results from this study also indicate very good agreement between prelaunch measurements and vicarious calibration data for all Landsat 7 reflective bands except Band 4. Values are within about 3.5% of each other, except for Band 4, which differs by 10%. Coefficient of variation (CV) values derived from selected targets in the imagery were also analyzed. The Niobrara Landsat 7 imagery was found to have lower CV values than Landsat 5 data, implying that lower levels of noise characterize Landsat 7 data than current Landsat 5 data. It was also found that following radiometric normalization, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery and classification products of Landsats 5 and 7 were very similar. This implies that data from the two sensors can be used to measure and monitor the same landscape phenomena and that Landsats 5 and 7 data can be used interchangeably with proper caution. In addition, it was found that difference imagery produced using Landsat 7 ETM+ data are of excellent quality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

An algorithm for turbidity estimation was developed and applied to Landsat TM images to monitor the turbid water on the mire surface during the snow-melting season. We used spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to produce a turbidity estimation model. The SMA \"unmixes\" a mixed pixel determining the fractions due to each spectral end member. In this study, we used four end members (1, alder; 3, reed; 3, high-concentration turbid water (485 ppm); 4, low-concentration turbid water(10 ppm) measured in the test site. The WTI was determined by the following equation: WTI = a(max)/(a(max) + a(min)), where a(max) is abundance of high-concentration turbid water and a(min) is abundance of low concentration turbid water. The end-member spectra of alder and reed were measured in the laboratory using specimens collected at the test site. The spectrum of turbid water was measured at the test sites. The relative abundance of each end member was estimated based on this spectral information using SMA. The same formula was applied to Landsat TM images. Then we applied the WTI equation to the end-member images to obtain a WTI map. In the mire wetland region, turbid water spreads under alder trees and reed grasses. Tb verify our turbidity estimation method based on WTI under these conditions, we constructed a small experimental wetland consisting of mixed stands of alder acid reed. WTI was calculated from the mixed spectrum of this \"artificial wetland\" and the regression curve for the relation between WTI and the actual turbidity was determined (R-2=.91). Finally, this regression equation was used to derive a turbidity map from the WTI image. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The results indicated differences between nadir and off-nadir radiative temperature of up to 5 K. The data also illustrated that, under clear sky and constant vegetation conditions, this difference is well correlated with surface soil moisture. However, the correlation decreased when the same comparison was made under changing vegetation conditions. To investigate the possibility of deriving component surface temperatures (soil and vegetation) using dual-angle observations of directional radiative temperature, two radiative transfer models (RTM) with different degrees of complexity were used. The results showed that despite their differences, the two models performed similarly in predicting the directional radiative temperature at a third angle. In contrast to other investigations, our study indicated that the impact of ignoring the cavity effect term is not very significant. However, omitting the contribution of the incoming long-wave radiation on measured directional radiance seemed to have a much larger impact. Finally, sensitivity analysis showed that an accuracy of better than 10% on the plant area index (PAI) was required for achieving a precision of 1 K for inverted vegetation temperature. An error of 1 K in measured directional radiative temperature can lead to an error of about 1 K in the soil and vegetation temperatures derived by inverting the RTM. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

In the northern mixed grass prairie, such changes are predicted to take the form of shifts in the relative ground cover of C3 and C4 photosynthetic types. In this study, we explore the feasibility of using two-date remote sensing data as a potential tool for monitoring these shifts. Our approach is based on the well-described asynchronous seasonality of C3 and C4 species. We hypothesize that the ratios of early-season to late-season aboveground live biomass (B-early/B-late) will decrease as sites become more C4-dominated, and that if B-early and B-late can be reliably estimated using spectral data, it may be feasible to predict C4 species coverage (%C4) from commercially available satellite information. Using spectral and botanical measurements from three upland communities in the Canadian mixed grass prairie, we (a) examined the relationship between various spectral vegetation indices and aboveground live biomass, (b) investigated the nature of the relationship between remotely sensed estimated of B-early/B-late and %C4 at multiple sample resolutions (0.5 m, 2.5 m, 10 m and 50 m), and (c) assessed whether these relationships were dependent on the vegetation index used to estimate biomass. We found a log-linear relationship between each spectral index and aboveground live biomass. Negative linear relationships were found between %C4 and remotely sensed B-early/B-late at all sampling resolutions. These relationships were strongest at sampling resolutions of 10 m and 50 m. The strengths and forms of relationships were found to be partially vegetation index-dependent. Stronger relationships between variants at coarser resolutions likely result from the smoothing of fine-scale variation in aboveground live biomass and C4 species coverage. Our results suggest that commercially available satellite data at resolutions of 10 m to 50 m (e.g., Landsat Thematic Mapper) may offer the potential for estimating coverage of C4 species and that the choice of vegetation index used to estimate biomass is relatively unimportant. However, we caution that for this technique to be operationally useful, statistical model performance must be strengthened and developed to provide both temporal and spatial generality. Further investigation is needed to examine the applicability of this approach to other growing seasons, community types, and grassland regions.

Measurements have been made with a Li-Cor Model 1800 integrating sphere apparatus coupled to an Ocean Optics Model ST1000 fiber spectrometer in which the same leaves are illuminated alternately with and without fluorescence-exciting radiation in order to separate the fluorescence emission component from the reflectance spectrum. The resulting difference spectrum is shown experimentally to be consistent with a fluorescence signature imposed on the inherent leaf reflectance signature. A study of the diurnal change in leaf reflectance spectra, combined with fluorescence measurements with the PAM-20000 Fluorometer, show that the difference spectra are consistent with observed diurnal changes in steady-state fluorescence. In addition, the time decay in the difference signature from repetitive leaf spectral reflectance measurements is seen to be consistent with the time decay of the leaf fluorescence signal (Kautsky effect) of dark-adapted leaves. The expected effects of chlorophyll fluorescence emission on the apparent spectral reflectance from a single leaf are also simulated theoretically using the doubling radiative transfer method. These modeling results demonstrate that the laboratory observations of a difference spectrum with broad peak at about 750 nm and a much smaller peak near 690 nm are in agreement with theory. Model simulation shows that chlorophyll pigment and fluorescence each affect indices that are being used in optical remote sensing to characterize pigment levels and stress in vegetation canopies.

Research by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service and Agricultural Research Service at Jornada has been continuous since 1912. The Jornada has been a National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research site since 1981. These long-term investigations have provided ground data on vegetation characteristics, ecosystem dynamics, and vegetation response to changing physical and biological conditions. To complement the programs of ground measurements, a campaign called JORNEX (JORNada EXperiment) began in 1995 to collect remotely sensed data from aircraft and satellite platforms to provide spatial and temporal data on physical: and biological states of the Jornada rangeland. A wide range of ground, aircraft, and satellite data have been collected on the physical, vegetative, thermal, and radiometric properties of three ecosystems (grass, grass/shrub transition, and shrub) typical of the Jornada rangeland and of southwestern U.S, deserts. Spatial surface energy balance estimates were made from a combination of parameters and state variables estimated from aircraft and ground data. Landscape surface roughness was evaluated with the laser altimetry data and used to estimate aerodynamic roughness. Data from different platforms allowed the evaluation of the landscape at different scales. These measurements are being used to quantity hydrologic budgets and plant responses to change in components in the water and energy balance at the Jornada.

Unlike conventional microwave and optical sensors, lidar sensors directly measure the distribution of vegetation material along the vertical axis and can be used to provide three-dimensional, or volumetric, characterizations of vegetation structure. Ecological applications of scanning lidar have hitherto used one-dimensional indices to characterize canopy height. A novel three-dimensional analysis of lidar waveforms was developed to characterize the total volume and spatial organization of vegetation material and empty space within the forest canopy. These aspects of the physical structure of canopies have been infrequently measured, from either field or remote methods. We applied this analysis to 22 plots in Douglas-fir/western hemlock stands on the west slope of the Cascades Range in Oregon. Each plot had coincident lidar data and field measurements of stand structure. We compared results from the novel analysis to two earlier methods of canopy description. Using the indices of canopy structure from all three methods of description as independent variables in a stepwise multiple regression, we were able to make nonasymptotic predictions of biomass and leaf area index (LAI) over a wide range, up to 1200 Mg ha(-1) of biomass and art LAI of 12, with 90% and 75% of variance explained respectively. Furthermore, we were able to make accurate estimates of other stand structure attributes, including the mean and standard deviation of diameter at breast height, the number of steins greater than 100 cm in diameter and independent estimates of the basal area of Douglas-fir and western hemlock. These measurements can be directly related to indices of forest stand structural complexity, such as those developed for old-growth forest characterisation. Indices of canopy structure developed using the novel, three-dimensional analysis accounted for most of the variables used in predictive equations generated by the stepwise multiple regression.

Many land management applications, including wildlife habitat studies, can benefit from knowledge of mixes. This article examines various algorithms that use data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite to estimate mixtures of vegetation types within forest stands. Included in the study are maximum likelihood classification and linear mixture models as well as a new methodology based on the ARTMAP neural network. Two paradigms are considered: classification methods, which describe stand-level vegetation mixtures as mosaics of pixels, each identified with its primary vegetation class; and mixture methods, which treat samples as blends of vegetation, even at the pixel level. Comparative analysis of these mixture estimation methods, tested on data from the Plumas National Forest, yields the following conclusions: 1) Accurate estimates of proportions of hardwood and conifer cover within stands can be obtained, particularly when brush is not present in the understory; 2) ARTMAP outperforms statistical methods and linear mixture models in both the classification and the mixture paradigms; 3) topographic correction fails to improve mapping accuracy; and 4) the new ARTMAP mixture system produces the most accurate overall results. The Plumas data set has been made available to other researchers for further development of new mapping methods and comparison with the quantitative studies presented here, which establish initial benchmark standards.

Band depths of absorption features at these wavelengths were found to also be highly correlated with the chemistry of four other sites. A subset of data from the eastern U.S, forest sites was used to derive linear equations that rc;ere applied to the remaining data to successfully estimate their nitrogen, lignin, and cellulose concentrations. Correlations were highest for nitrogen (R-2 from 0.75 to 0.94). The consistent results indicate the possibility of establishing a single equation capable of estimating the chemical concentrations in a wide variety of species front the reflectance spectra of dried leaves. The extension of this method to remote sensing was investigated. The effects of leaf water content, sensor signal-to-noise and bandpass, atmospheric effects, and background soil exposure were examined. Leaf water was found to be the greatest challenge to extending this empirical method to the analysis of fresh whole leaves and complete vegetation canopies. The influence of leaf water on reflectance spectra must be removed to within 10%. Other effects were reduced by continuum removal and normalization of band depths. If the effects of leaf water can be compensated for, it might be possible to extend this method to remote sensing data acquired by imaging spectrometers to give estimates of nitrogen, lignin, and cellulose concentrations over large areas for use in ecosystem studies.

The method we developed consists of a fit of NDVI predicted by line segment to AVHRR-NDVI time series. It made it possible to derive the budburst and senescence timing, and then the phenological cycle duration. A relationship found in the literature between leaf area index (LAI) and NDVI showed that LAI was about 1 for the satellite-derived budburst and about 1.5 for the satellite-derived senescence. We tested the method on three nearly monospecific (Quercus petraea and Fagus sylvatica L.) forests located in France using a 6-year NOAA/AVHRR archive during the 1989-1994 period. The satellite-derived phenology revealed differences in relational to the composition and the climatic features of the study areas: 1) the phenological cycle duration of oak was longer (34 days) for southern than for northern forests, 2) in the North of France, beech trees were buckling earlier (5.6 days) than oak trees, 3) the interannual variability of budburst was significantly lower for beech than for oak trees. The comparison with ground phenological observations found in the literature showed the spatio-temporal coherence of the satellite-derived phenology A good correlation was also found between the satellite-derived budburst and the budburst timing predicted from air temperatures using the thermal time model.

Polarization effects include an enhanced range of backscatter across grassland classes for 45 degrees cross polarization at L band and differences in the pedestal height of the C band polarization signature for species classes. The results of drainage modeling suggest that soil moisture is a significant confounding factor influencing radar backscatter from the grassland. Simple models using logistic probability of association between height class and radar backscatter in a Bayesian inference engine, and a simple threhold based on logistic probability of association between wet areas and P-vv are examined. Our results suggest that combined imagery from C and L band satellite-borne SAR sensors have potential for current application in grassland monitoring.

The system was primarily designed to acquire multiband images for ascertaining spectral bands and/or band combinations to better characterize and assess natural resources. The ADVIS is comprised of 12 charge coupled device (CCD) analog video cameras and a computer equipped with a single multichannel digitizing board. The system cameras are equipped with various narrowband (6.5-12.6 nm bandwidths) interference filters to acquire images within the visible/near-infrared (NIR) (400-1000 nm) spectral waveband. The ADVIS multichannel capturing board is capable of obtaining 12 analog video inputs that are readily converted into digital images having 640 by 480 pixels resolution. The digitizing board has four RGB bunks which have the capability of generating four synchronized real-time false color composite images from any selectable three-band combination among the 12 cameras, as keyed by the RGB inputs of the digitizing board. The computer system has a two GB storage capacity hard dl-iue that can store 2000 RGB 24-bit color images. The system is unique because the quad real-time color composite imagery It provides is of adequate quality for assessing scenes of interest and there is no need for post-processing band registration immediately after the flight mission in order to evaluate the imagery. Also, the display of the quad images readily depicts which composite image(s) provides better differences among land-use cover types in the scene. This imagery, however, needs to be registered for image processing and analysis. The display of the black-and-white (B&W) image components (spectral bands) of the composite images provide basic information to assist in the interpretation of the color composites and to qualitatively understand the interaction of ecological parameters with the electromagnetic spectrum. The ADVIS multispectral image acquisition may determine the best band(s) for characterizing and/or detecting problems of the various natural resources.

Under all wind conditions encountered in this study, the measured damping ratio (i.e., the ratio of the radar backscatter from a slick-free and a slick-covered water surface) increases with increasing Bragg wavenumber. It is shown that not only Marangoni damping theory, but also wind-induced effects, primarily the energy input by the wind into the wave spectrum, also have to be taken ito account. The reductions measured at low to moderate wind speeds (3.5-4 m/s and 5 m/s) are qualitatively explained by means of a comparison of the different source terms of the action balance equation. For the case of high wind speed (12 m/s) a theoretical model for the damping ratios is developed. Using this model, the experimental data can well be reproduced, and the absence of the Marangoni damping maximum at intermediate Bragg wavenumbers (approximately 100 rad/m) can be interpreted. Furthermore, the model can explain the similarities between the radar backscatter reductions measured over quasibiogenic and anthropogenic surface films under high wind conditions.

These legume crops have different canopy architectures. These legume crops have different canopy architectures. During crop growth nine vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated from reflectance measurements taken in TM2, TM3, TM4, and TM5 bands. Five VIs were ratio indices, (RVI, NDVI, SAVI2, TSAVI, and RDVI), two were orthogonal indices (PVI and GVI3), and the other two (STVI and CRVI) included the mid-infrared band. The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) from a ceptometer and reflectance were measured simultaneously. Linear, exponential, and power relationships between VI and fAPAR were constructed to evaluate the capability of each VI to estimate fAPAR in these crops. The influence of solar angle on VI determination was also studied, using reflectance measurements at several hours during the day at two different crop growth stages. Results show that, in both species, different relationships are needed for pre-and postmaximum leaf area index (LAImax) phases of development. In preLAImax of both species, all VI correlated highly with fAPAR, but the coefficients of determination (R-2) for ratio indices were generally higher than orthogonal indices (PVI and GVI3) and indices with the TM5 band (STVI and CRVI). Among ratio indices, in pre-LAImax, R-2 did not differ significantly between those that included the soil effect (SAVI2 and TSAVI) and those that did not (RVI, NDVI, and RDVI). Relationships with indices that include the TM5 band (STVI and CRVI) showed a great slope, increasing the sensitivity of the estimates of fAPAR to errors and frequency of the reflectance measurements. During pre-LAImax phase, curvilinear relationships are better for pea canopies, while linear ones were found more appropriate for faba beans. In post-LAImax, linear relations were in general better, especially in peas. Relationships did not differ between irrigated and rainfed treatments within crops, even in early stages of growth with poor soil cover, so that only one was proposed for each species. All VI values were greatly affected by the hour of measurement at solar angles greater than 45 degrees. The indices most affected by solar angle changes were STVI and CRVI. We can conclude that simple indices, RVI and NDVI, based on reflectance measurements in TM3 and TM4 bands can be used to accurately asses canopy development in faba bean and semileafless peas, allowing good and fast estimations of fAPAR and LAI, both important parameters in crop physiology and modeling. More research in different type of soils is needed to check if ratio, SAVI2 and TSAVI, or orthogonal, PVI and GVI3, indices that include the effect of soils can improve the estimation of fAPAR in these two crops.

Spectral reflectance data collected during the EISAC\'89 Campaign from and experimental grassland site on Tadham Moor, Somerset, United Kingdom were used for the analysis, together with canopy biomass, chlorophyll, and water content variables. The analysis focuses mainly on the correlation between percentage water content per unit area of canopy and spectral parameters across the two water absorption features, around 940 nm and 1150 nm. Correlation analysis revealed that both the strength of the peak correlation between the first derivative of reflectance and water content and its wavelength position were sensitive to the degree of smoothing for the 1150 nm feature, although this was not the case for the 940 nm water absorption feature. This sensitivity is attributed to the fact that different levels of smoothing emphasize different spectral features across a wavelength region where the first derivative of reflectance and the biophysical variable are generally highly correlated. The effect emphasizes that the exact position of peak correlation between these two variables should be interpreted with caution, especially across spectral regions where the correlation is generally high. A simple reflectance ratio based on the relative depth of the water absorption feature was found to be more closely related to canopy water content and insensitive to the degree of spectral smoothing.

Here we develop and describe a methodological approach for assessing the accuracy of large-area cover maps, using as a test case the 21.9 million ha cover map developed for Utah Gap Analysis.

Our design ultimately combined clustered and subsampled field data stratified by ecological modeling unit and accessibility (hereafter a mixed design). We next outline estimation formulas for simple map accuracy measures under our mixed design and report results for eight major cover types and the three ecoregions mapped as part of the Utah Gap Analysis. Overall accuracy of the map was 83.2% (SE=1.4). Within ecoregions, accuracy ranged from 78.9% to 85.0%. Accuracy by cover type varied, ranging from a low of 50.4% for barren to a high of 90.6% for man modified.

The methodology includes corrections for the intervening atmosphere by using the 6S radiative transfer model. Additional corrections for the anisotropic nature of snow reflectance and the conversion from a narrow- into a broadband albedo are made based on in situ measurements from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology University of Colorado camp at 69-degrees-34\'N, 49-degrees-18\'W. Comparison with surface albedo field measurements indicates that before the onset of snow melt, agreement is good between the satellite-derived and measured surface albedo. After melt begins, it is difficult to compare the satellite values with the field data owing to melt water ponding on the ice sheet surface.

Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) data was used to generate maps of total sea. ice concentration, using the NASA Team algorithm with the 19 GHz and 37 GHz channels, and using a polarization-based algorithm with the 85.5 GHz channels. When compared with shipboard ice observations, the total sea ice concentration estimated from the 85.5 GHz algorithm are at least as accurate as those from the algorithm that uses only the lower SSM/I frequencies, despite the potential for greater difficulty in dealing with cloud liquid water contamination in the 85.5 GHz signal during the Arctic summer. Near the edge of the ice pack, the 85.5 GHz algorithm often provided more accurate estimates of total ice concentration when compared with surface observations, most likely because of the finer grid spacing at 85.5 GHz (12.5 km vs. 25 km for 37 GHz). However, when using the 85.5 GHz algorithm over regions of lower ice concentration, the reference polarizations in a given image must be chosen with care because over lower sea ice concentration the polarization-based algorithm is more sensitive to cloud opacity and can easily and substantially underestimate the ice concentration. The 85.5 GHz total sea ice retrievals are compared with in situ snow wetness measurements. This comparison suggests that, despite the higher atmospheric opacity at 85.5 GHz, information about sea ice surface properties that affect emissivity can be obtained from these SSM/I channels.

Results indicate that SAR data are able to discern structural differences relevant to bird habitat quality within floristically homogeneous stands, while multispectral sensors successfully identified floristic differences among habitat types. Simplifying indices of bird diversity showed ambiguous changes across the site; however, the abundances of individual species were observed to change significantly across both floristic and structural gradients. These results suggest that efforts to map bird diversity should focus on species-specific habitat relationships and that some measure of vegetation structure is needed to understand bird habitat.

Basement rock units (granitoids and gneisses) and the fractures associated with them at Bir Safsaf are shown here for the first time to be clearly delineated using C- and L-band SAR images. The detectability of most geologic features is dependent primarily on radar frequency, as shown for wind erosion patterns in bedrock at X-band (3 cm wavelength), and for geologic units and sand and clay-filled fractures in weathered crystalline basement rocks at C-band (6 m) and L-band (24 cm). By contrast, Quaternary paleodrainage channels are detectable at all three radar frequencies owing, among other things, to an usually thin cover of blow sand.

Two algorithms developed recently for estimation of moisture content in bare soil were applied to these measurements and the results were compared with those sampled on the ground. There is a good agreement between the values of soil moisture estimated by either one of the algorithms and those measured from ground sampling for bare or sparsely vegetated fields. The standard error from this comparison is on the order of 0.05-0.06 cm(3)/cm(3), which is comparable to that expected from a regression between backscattering coefficients and measured soil moisture. Both algorithms provide a poor estimation of soil moisture or fail to give solutions to areas covered with moderate or fail to give solutions to areas covered with moderate or dense vegetation. Even for bare soils the number of pixels that bear no numerical solution from the application of either one of the two algorithms to the data is not negligible. Results from using one of these algorithms indicate that the fraction of these pixels becomes larger as the bare soils become drier. The other algorithm generally gives a larger fraction of these pixels when the fields are vegetation-covered. The implication and impact of these features are discussed in this article.

In situ SST measurements from moored buoy data were used to validate the satellite SST products revealing the multichannel SST (MCSST) to be most representative of the buoy SSTs. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was performed to characterize the principal components of the annual SST variability. The first EOF mode (64.2% of the variance) indicates that the variance of the satellite derived MCSST has a strong meridional structure with a marked seasonal modulation. This first mode suggests the importance of \'\'warm pool\'\' with a maximum just south of the equator at about 170 degrees E. The second mode (8.7% of the variance) and the rest of the EOF modes show more complex spatial structures. The large amount of variance explained by the first mode compared to the second mode indicates that the seasonal variance of the warm pool dominates all other variability. This strong seasonal behavior is also clearly seen in the monthly meridional position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The annual mean SST map shows a persistent warm pool from 13 degrees S to 10 degrees N and 130 degrees E to 170 degrees W, which is larger than the COARE intensive observing period (IOP) domain. Monthly SST means in the region suggest a seasonal cycle in phase with the solar cycle. Warm pool total area variance and its centroid movement demonstrate similar annual cycles.

For this reason it was necessary to develop a specific method for retrieving the mean fluorescence lifetime of a complex plant canopy under field condition. In a first step, the position and the reflectance characteristics of each reflecting canopy element is determined from the deconvolution of the backscattered signal. In a second step, the parameters obtained are introduced into the fluorescence function in order to determine the mean fluorescence lifetime. The validity of the deconvolution method has been tested for numerous situations, using simulated laser shots on a 3-D canopy mockup. The results obtained show a very good agreement between estimated and input parameters. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.', 'INRA,AVIGNON,FRANCE.

The method relies on the fact that the slope of a very strong linear statistical relationship (R(2) > 0.95) between two indices varies significantly with the structure of the canopy. The first index (RVI(c)) is the ratio between reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) and in the red channels, where intercept (b) of the soil line is substracted from the NIR: RVI(c) = (NIR - b)/Red. The second index (GEO) is a new index calculated from the indices (PVI and SLI) introduced by Richardson and Wiegand (1977; Wiegand and Richardson, 1982): GEO = (SLI(2) + PVI2)/(SLI - PVI). GEO is much more sensitive to canopy architecture than is RVI(c). Thus the ratio of RVI(c), vs GEO, or the slope in such graphs, increases as leaf angle increases. Applied to three wheat cultivars, the smallest slope of the RVI(c) vs. GEO is for the cultivar that differed from the others by a mean leaf angle of about 15 degrees or less. The significance of the approach is that it helps identify leaf angle differences among observed canopies when leaf area index (LAI) is unknown but has a sufficient space variability. This method is illustrated by the RVI(c)-GEO relations within a durum wheat field in the south of France observed on two SPOT satellite scenes. An Increase of leaf erectness between tillering stage and early grain filling phase (2 weeks after anthesis) is clearly shown by the evolution of the slope of the RVI(c) vs. GEO relation.RP Malet, P (通讯作者)，INRA, F-84914 AVIGNON 9, FRANCE.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 24, 6, 7, 1, 3, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

This increase can be described by an exponential function and a linear term, which depend on the power density at the laser spot, on the grade of inhibition of photosynthetic activity by herbicides or environmental stress, and on the duration of the dark adaptation time. A single measurement with the msec pulse method requires only a short time because the period of dark adaptation, necessary for the induction kinetics, can be reduced to several 100 msec.

The measurements were made using two optical instruments: the Plant Canopy Analyzer (LAI-2000, LI-COR) and the TRAC (Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies). The TRAC was recently developed to quantify the effect of canopy architecture on optical measurements of leaf area index. The stands were located on georeferenced Landsat TM images using global positioning system (GPS) measurements. It is found that late spring Landsat images are superior to summer images for determining overstory LAI in boreal conifer stands because the effect of the understory is minimized in the spring before the full growth of the understory and moss cover. The effective LAI, obtained from gap fraction measurements assuming a random distribution of foliage spatial positions, was found to be better correlated to SR and NDVI than LAI. The effective LAI is less variable and easier to measure than LAI, and is also an intrinsic attribute of plant canopies. It is therefore suggested to use effective LAI as the most important parameter for radiation interception considerations.RP Chen, JM (通讯作者)，CANADA CTR REMOTE SENSING, 419 588 BOOTH ST, OTTAWA, ON K1A OY7, CANADA.RI Chen, Jing/AAD-4768-2020', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Chen, Jing/0000-0002-8682-1293', NULL, NULL, 40, 592, 737, 2, 178, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Likewise, polar scenes often contain pixels with mixed classes (e.g., sea ice and cloud). This article uses a combination of fuzzy logic classification methods, noise reduction in AVHRR Channel 3 data using Wiener filtering methods (Simpson and Yhann, 1994), and a physically motivated rule base which makes effective use of the Wiener filtered Channel 3 data to more accurately segment polar imagery. The new method\'s improved classification skill compared to more traditional methods, as well as its regional independence, is demonstrated. The algorithm is computationally efficient and hence is suitable for analyzing the large volumes of polar imagery needed in many global change studies.RP Simpson, JJ (通讯作者)，UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,SCRIPPS SATELLITE OCEANOG CTR,DIGITAL IMAGE ANAL LAB,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 44, 27, 27, 0, 3, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

In order to ascertain the extent to which cloudiness prevents Landsat imagery from providing such datasets in the European Arctic, cloud cover data for all imagery acquired during April-September, 1983-92, for 15 glaciologically significant areas (each represented by a Landsat path/row) were examined. Cloudiness values were derived from the Eurimage LEDA (onLine Earthnet Data Availability) catalogue. The results indicate that regions of the European Arctic may be classified into three groups on the basis of the frequency of availability of high quality imagery (<35% cloud cover). Marked seasonal differences are also evident between the groups. Comparable findings from previous cloud cover studies using ground station data illustrate that the scenes used in this study are representative of the regions in which they lie. The relative abilities of Landsat MSS/TM and ERS-1 SAR data to provide multitemporal datasets are compared; although SAR is unaffected by cloud, ERS-1 has a longer revisit interval (multidisciplinary phase) than Landsat. Only in East Greenland has Landsat generated a sufficient number of high quality scenes to provide a useful multitemporal dataset. Elsewhere in the European Arctic the prevalence of the cloud cover is such that it may prevent the effective use of VIS/NIR data for certain glaciological studies.

The aim was to evaluate suitable function types for a proposed change detection technique. In this technique, multitemporal relatively calibrated satellite data are compared within spectrally homogeneous forest stands. In boreal forests, only minor parts of a large forest area are likely to substantially change within a few years. Thus, for change detection in forest stands, the forest land itself might be used as spectral reference for statistical image normalization techniques. The regression functions were used to predict the pixel values for the TM data at a recent acquisition from TM data obtained during an earlier acquisition. All functions were validated with a set of pixel values for forest without changes. No large error reductions were obtained with the use of ancillary forest data. Regression functions computed from only forest pixels gave higher coefficients of determination than functions computed from all image pixels or from dark and bright areas only. The relationship between spectral data from different years was approximately linear. Robust regression performed better than the least squares method when outliers were present. Also an iterated histogram matching was found to give an accuracy similar to that of band-to-band robust regression. Regression methods are sensitive to geometrical errors between spatially registered imagery, but histogram matching is not. Multiple regression functions from all TM bands were considerably better than the band-to-band regressions, especially for Bands TM 1-3. Thus when the geometric errors are small, multiple regression may be used instead of histogram matching. The good performance of the multiple regression also suggests that this method could be used even for change detection between imagery from different sensors.RP OLSSON, H (通讯作者)，SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,FAC FORESTRY,REMOTE SENSING LAB,S-90183 UMEA,SWEDEN.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 28, 46, 50, 0, 2, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The model was applied to simulate directional changes of spectral reflectances from a tallgrass canopy and compared with field measurements by Deering and Middleton (1990). A modified two-stream approach was used in the model by considering the transfers of upward reflected and diffuse radiation in different viewing directions, downward direct and diffuse radiation, and their dependences upon canopy leaf orientation. An analytical solution was derived to allow a fast computation of directional reflectances based on canopy parameters or a retrieval of canopy parameters based on reflectance measurements. Modeled spectral reflectances are generally in a good agreement with measurements, and effects of inhomogeneous canopy characteristics such as \'\'hot spot\'\' and of soil reflection were examined. Both modeled and observed reflectances show strong backscattering and relatively weak forward scattering in the red band, but a more symmetric distribution in the near-infrared band. The directional changes of reflectance in both red and near-infrared bands are dominated by primary scattering the magnitudes of reflectance in the near-infrared band are largely influenced by secondary scattering. Model simulations for three theoretical leaf angle distributions (planophile, spherical, and erectophile) show that hemispherical reflectance or albedo could be overestimated by nadir reflectance at a small solar zenith angle and underestimated at a large solar zenith angle. The error, however, can be reduced to a minimum at an optimal solar zenith angle which has the same magnitude for the three leaf angle distributions but decreases with increasing canopy leaf area index. Modeled vegetation spectral index, NDVI, appears to vary by 10-24% with viewing angle for a given leaf angle distribution and canopy leaf area index, and it generally has a larger value for forward scattering than for backscattering.RP GAO, W (通讯作者)，ARGONNE NATL LAB,DIV ENVIRONM RES,BLDG 203,RM J152,9700 S CASS AVE,ARGONNE,IL 60439, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 37, 22, 23, 0, 6, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The detection of these bands was rendered difficult by the lack of detail in reflectance spectra.  It was therefore necessary to manipulate the reflectance spectra so that absorption bands due to specific pigments could be detected and their spectral maxima defined.  It was found that by dividing soybean reflectance spectra by an arbitrarily selected reference soybean reflectance spectrum, ratio spectra were obtained in which the absorption bands could be distinctly seen and their wavelength defined.  These ratio spectra allowed the defining of those bands corresponding to the absorption bands of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids.  The strong linear relationships of certain combinations of the bands in the ratio spectra to the concentrations of the photosynthetic pigments made it possible to develop a ratio analysis of reflectance spectra algorithm (RARS) by which the concentrations of these pigments could be calculated from the reflectance spectra.

Stressed Norway spruce was found to have approximately 20% greater relative reflectance in the 1.0-1.3-mu-m region compared to the control canopy in the image obtained at 0925 h 13 days after stress induction. The difference in PSI and RWC between stressed and control was measured at 1.2 MPa and estimated at 7%, respectively. However, the difference in reflectance decreased to insignificance in the image taken at 1219 h that same day when the differences in PSI and RWC were approximately 0.72 MPa and 5%. In white pine, no significant differences in reflectance between stressed and control canopies were found in images obtained 14 days and 20 days after treatment with estimated differences in PSI and RWC of 0.3 MPa and 6%. Because extensive ground data was required at times of AIS-2 overflights to detect these small reflectance differences, we believe that water stress in conifer canopies may not be routinely detectable at an operational landscape scale.', 'UNIV MONTANA, SCH FORESTRY, MISSOULA, MT 59812 USA.', 'University of Montana System; University of Montana', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 48, 50, 51, 0, 14, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The chlorophyll-driven optical properties are in fact so strong as to allow global satellite mapping of the pigment concentration in the upper ocean using upwelled water-leaving radiances.  In this paper, extensive experimental evidence is presented to strongly suggest that upwelled water-leaving spectral radiances (and therefore the submarine light field source) also include physical scattering and absorption effects of photosynthetic accessory pigments such as phycoerythrin.  In the water column, the presence of phycoerythrin was measured over wide regions of the ocean using well-established airborne laser-induced spectral fluorescence techniques.  Active-passive correlation spectroscopy methods revealed that concurrently measured water-leaving spectral radiances in the almost-equal-to 600 nm spectral region were highly correlated with the laser-induced phycoerythrin pigment fluorescence.

We modeled the changes in tree canopy height across Europe from 2001 to 2021 using the multidecadal spectral data from the Landsat archive and calibration data from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidars. Annual tree canopy height was modeled using regression tree ensembles and integrated with annual tree canopy removal maps to produce harmonized tree height map time series. From these time series, we derived annual tree canopy extent maps using a >= 5 m tree height threshold. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) for both ALS-calibrated and GEDI-calibrated tree canopy height maps was <= 4 m. The user\'s and producer\'s accuracies estimated using reference sample data are >= 94% for the tree canopy extent maps and >= 80% for the annual tree canopy removal maps. Analyzing the map time series, we found that the European tree canopy extent area increased by nearly 1% overall during the past two decades, with the largest increase observed in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and the British Isles. However, after the year 2016, the tree canopy extent in Europe declined. Some regions reduced their tree canopy extent between 2001 and 2021, with the highest reduction observed in Fennoscandia (3.5% net decrease). The continental extent of tall tree canopy forests (>= 15 m height) decreased by 3% from 2001 to 2021. The recent decline in tree canopy extent agrees with the FAO statistics on timber harvesting intensification and with the increasing extent and severity of natural disturbances. The observed decreasing tree canopy height indicates a reduction in forest carbon storage capacity in Europe.', '[Turubanova, Svetlana; Potapov, Peter; Hansen, Matthew C.; Li, Xinyuan; Tyukavina, Alexandra; Pickens, Amy H.; Hernandez-Serna, Andres; Arranz, Adrian Pascual] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

However, the homogeneity assumption for meteorological forcing and surface properties involved in TFM contradicts the characteristics of heterogeneous regions, leading to high uncertainty at regional scale, especially under energy-limited or strong advection conditions. Therefore, this study examined the linear relationship between soil moisture availability (Lambda SM), evapotranspiration efficiency (Lambda ET) and radiation surface temperature (Trad), and developed an Independent Framework-based dual-source ET Model (IFEM) for heterogeneous regions. By fixing two key meteorological forcing variables, air temperature (Ta) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and three surface characteristic parameters, aerodynamic resistance (ra), albedo (alpha) and the ratio of soil heat flux to net radiation (Gamma), the IFEM constructs a uniform fractional vegetation cover (fc)- Trad space. In this uniform fc-Trad space, isolines of Lambda SM and Lambda ET are aligned with those of Trad, and an independent trapezoid framework is constructed for each pixel of RS images. It avoids the systematic bias caused by the distorted trapezoid space involved in traditional TFMs. The proposed model was applied in a hydrologically semi-enclosed irrigation area, the Hetao Irrigation District, with Landsat and MODIS datasets from 2016 to 2020 to evaluate its performance at the field and region scales. Firstly, the IFEM was capable of retrieving latent heat with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 34.43 W m- 2 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.68%, compared with the measurements from flux towers. Secondly, the IFEM reasonably separated the soil (MAPE = 21.33%) and canopy (MAPE = 14.33%) components from ET, compared with the soil evaporation observed by micro-lysimeters and the plant transpiration calculated by sap velocity upscaling technology. Thirdly, the IFEM showed high accuracy in estimating annual total ET with a percentage error range within +/- 3.0%, compared against the regional water balance calculations. Overall, the IFEM demonstrated high robustness and accuracy for field-scale and regional-scale applications, validating its potential as a reliable method for mapping regional ET in heterogeneous regions.', '[Wang, Shuai; Wang, Chaozi; Zhang, Chenglong; Wang, Weishu; Wang, Pu; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Xingwang; Rong, Yao; Wang, Di; Huang, Guanhua; Huo, Zailin] China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

Such gaps can be minimized with geostationary satellites owing to their higher scanning frequency over a given region, allowing more sampling opportunities as clouds move. However, geostationary ocean color missions have not been available for most regions of the globe. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) aboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R series (GOES-R) is a potential alternative for the U.S. owing to improved signal-to-noise ratio compared with its predecessors. Nonetheless, retrieving [Chl-a] from ABI measurements is challenging; the number, placement, and width of its spectral bands are suboptimal and an \"ocean-grade\"atmospheric correction scheme is lacking. Here we describe the construction of a deep learning-based algorithm to derive [Chl-a] from GOES-16 ABI L1B radiance and ancillary data without an explicit atmospheric correction algorithm. A large (& SIM;22 million examples) training dataset of paired ABI observations and [Chl-a] estimates derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) were used to train, test and validate a 10-layer deep neural network model to retrieve [Chl-a] from ABI data. Preliminary results show that without atmospheric correction but with the aid of deep learning, it is possible to detect open ocean features with strong contrast such as across eddies and fronts, but there are still significant issues in coastal waters and occasionally in the open oceans. In general, the ABI-derived [Chl-a] agrees reasonably well with VIIRS-derived values in the open ocean during 3-5 h of the day. The location of oceanographic features such as fronts and eddies in the ABI-derived [Chl-a] maps are also coincident with those obtained from traditional ocean color and sea surface temperature retrievals. The findings of this study demonstrate that deep learning is a powerful tool for capturing intricate patterns that are too subtle for traditional algorithms developed by humans, Furthermore, the utilization of GOES-R ABI has the potential to complement polar-orbiting satellite data and mitigate data gaps.', '[Zheng, Guangming; Brown, Christopher W.; DiGiacomo, Paul M.] NOAA NESDIS Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.

These changes are affecting wetland productivity, species diversity, and biogeochemical cycles. However, given the diverse forms and structures of wetland vegetation communities, traditional wetland maps generated from lower spatial and spectral resolution satellite imagery lack community-level vegetation classification and miss spatially complex patterns. In this study, we built a cloud-based workflow to map wetland vegetation community of the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), Canada, by leveraging high-resolution (5-m) airborne multi-sensor datasets, namely NASA\'s Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), and a historical LiDAR archive. Validation of our classifications using ground references indicates that classifications derived from AVIRIS-NG have higher accuracies (& GE;87.9%) than either UAVSAR (65.6%) or LiDAR (75.9%) for mapping wetland vegetation communities. We also show improved classification accuracy when combining information from multiple sensors. In particular, incorporating AVIRIS-NG and UAVSAR datasets substantially reduced omission errors of wet graminoid and wet shrub classes from 29.6% to 20.5% and from 10.8% to 7.5%, respectively. Combining AVIRIS-NG and LiDAR datasets further improves overall accuracy (+2.2%) for most classifications, especially emergent vegetation, wet graminoid, and wet shrub. The best performing model, using features derived from all three sensors, achieved an overall accuracy of 93.5%. The framework established here can be used to leverage extensive airborne AVIRISNG and UAVSAR datasets collected across Alaska and northwest Canada to understand the spatial distribution of Arctic-Boreal wetland vegetation communities.', '[Wang, Chao; Pavelsky, Tamlin M.; Yang, Xiao; Langhorst, Theodore; Dolan, Wayana] Univ N Carolina, Dept Earth Marine & Environm Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.

The signal from the forest floor influences the interpretation of optical remote sensing (RS) data. Retrieval of forest floor reflectance properties has commonly been investigated with multiangular RS data, which often have a coarse spatial resolution. We developed a method that utilizes a forest reflectance model based on photon recollision probability to retrieve forest floor reflectance from near-nadir data. The method was tested in boreal, hemiboreal, and temperate forests in Europe, with hemispherical photos and airborne LiDAR as alternative data sources to provide forest canopy structural information. These two data sources showed comparable performance, thus demonstrating the value of using airborne LiDAR as the structural reflectance model input to derive wall-to-wall maps of forest floor reflectance. We derived such maps from multispectral Sentinel-2 MSI and hyperspectral PRISMA satellite images for a boreal forest site. The validation against in situ measurements showed fairly good performance of the retrievals in sparse forests (that had effective plant area index less than 2). In dense forests, the retrievals were less accurate, due to the small contribution of forest floor to the RS signal. We also demonstrated the use of the method in monitoring the recovery of forest floor vegetation after a thinning disturbance. The reflectance model that we used is computationally efficient, making it well applicable also to data from new and forthcoming hyperspectral satellite missions.', '[Hovi, Aarne; Schraik, Daniel; Kuusinen, Nea; Juola, Jussi; Rautiainen, Miina] Aalto Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Built Environm, POB 14100, Aalto 00076, Finland.

In this paper, we novelty proposed a multi-date change detection framework based on the variation in fractional vegetation cover (FCOVER), with enough ecological sense and physical basis to be generalizable across different plant commu-nities and burned landscapes with varying environmental conditions. This framework meets the definition of fire severity operationally used in the field as a biophysical indicator when fire effects on the understory and overstory layers are linked. The FCOVER was retrieved from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance scenes by inverting PROSAIL-D radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations using the random forest regression algorithm. FCOVER retrievals were validated in the field using burned and unburned control plots. We computed the FCOVERr metric as the ratio of post-fire to pre-fire FCOVER. We tested the relationship of the FCOVERr and the most common bi-temporal spectral indices in the literature, i.e. the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), the Relative dNBR (RdNBR) and the Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR), with the Composite Burn Index (CBI) measured in field plots for validation purposes in two case-study wildfires in the western Mediterranean Basin. We also calculated the transferability of FCOVERr and the spectral indices between different plant communities within each site, as well as between sites. The predictive errors of pre and post-fire FCOVER retrievals were found to be low (RMSE approximate to 10%) for the two study sites. Overall, the FCOVERr metric provided more accurate CBI estimations (R2 = 0.87 +/- 0.04) than spectral indices (R2 = 0.71 +/- 0.13). The CBI was linearly related with the FCOVERr metric for both sites, whereas the type of relationship with spectral indices was not consistent, which translated into better transferability performance of the FCOVERr metric (nRMSE = 14.27% +/- 3.75%) than that of the spectral indices (nRMSE = 21.97% +/- 8.09%), not only between different Mediterranean plant communities within sites, but also between the two sites. Spectral indices underestimated moderate to high fire severity to a greater extent than FCOVERr in the CBI field plots, and misclassified fire severity in several areas with patchiness fire effects identified in the field. The FCOVERr product proposed in this study may be a sound choice for the operational identification of priority areas for post-fire management.', '[Fernandez-Guisuraga, Jose Manuel; Fernandes, Paulo M.] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Ctr Investigaca & Tecnol Agroambientais & Biol, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal.

Passive microwave approaches for the retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE) often implement dry snow detection as one of the main processing steps. Reliable dry snow detection is thus crucial; however, common algorithms tend to underestimate snow cover extent. This study conducts a long-term assessment of six dry snow detection algorithms as part of ongoing GlobSnow SWE product development. We focus on terrestrial snow on the Northern Hemisphere, using exhaustive in situ snow depth measurements and spatially complete snow maps by the NOAA Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS). In addition to using conventional daily snow masks, cumulative snow masks are investigated as means to counteract underestimation and the results emphasise their potential for this purpose. Best performances are achieved by the cumulative versions of the algorithm of the EUMETSAT H SAF H11 product and of the decision tree by Grody and Basist (1996), which agree with in situ data by approximately 81% and 84% whilst differing from IMS maps by only about 15% and 11%, respectively. Their validation for hemispheric SWE retrieval in the GlobSnow framework, using in situ snow course SWE observations, shows a noticeable improvement of the current statistics especially during shallow snow conditions in autumn-reducing the bias by up to 2.2 mm and the RMSE by up to 2.0 mm.

To close this knowledge gap, this study first analyzed the main uncertainty factors in the procedure of multiscale validation, and then proposed the quantification method for measuring the uncertainty caused by different factors. Finally, the propagation law of these uncertainty factors into the final uncertainty of validation results was established. Our analysis demonstrates that the uncertainty of multiscale validation mainly comes from the errors in high-resolution albedo maps, the errors generated in the upscaling process, and the errors caused by the geolocation mismatch between reference albedo and satellite albedo. These uncertainty factors are uncorrelated with each other and linearly propagated into the final uncertainty of validation results. The influence of these uncertainty factors partly depends on their magnitudes and partly depends on their weighting coefficients. The systematic errors in highresolution albedo maps propagate into the errors of pixel scale ground \"truth\" linearly with slope coefficients equal to or slightly smaller than 1, depending on the std. of noise. And then the pixel scale ground \"truth\" propagates into the final validation results with the weighting coefficient close to -1. But the non-systematic errors are more likely to be balanced out through the upscaling process in the case of a small subpixel size. The errors generated in the upscaling procedure are generally within the range of -3%-3%. Moreover, their negative weighting coefficients are very small, with a magnitude of less than 0.01. Consequently, the contribution of the errors generated in the upscaling process is negligibly small. By contrast, the errors caused by geolocation mismatch are significant, with the values ranging from -10% to 25%, which exceed the 5% accuracy requirement of satellite albedo products proposed by GCOS. Furthermore, its contribution to the overall uncertainty of validation results is significant, with large weighting coefficients close to 1. The magnitudes of these uncertainty factors and their weighting coefficients show dependence on subpixel sizes. Generally, a fine subpixel size is preferred in multiscale validation because it not only reduces the influence of non-systematic errors of high-resolution albedo maps but also enables more stable and reliable upscaling results. This study deepens the consciousness and understanding of the uncertainty embedded in multiscale validation results, which takes an important step toward more reliable validation over heterogeneous surfaces.', '[Wu, Xiaodan; Tang, Rongqi; Wang, Jingping; Zeng, Qicheng; Li, Zheng] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.

The analyses focused on seismic (earthquake catalogs), atmospheric (climatological archives) and ionospheric data from ground to space (mainly satellite) in order to disclose the possible Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling (LAIC). The ionospheric investigations analysed and compared the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver network with in -situ observations from space thanks to both the European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm constellation and the China National Space Administration (CNSA in partnership with Italian Space Agency, ASI) satellite dedicated to search for possible ionospheric disturbances before medium-large earthquakes, i.e. the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01). An interesting comparison is made with another subsequent earthquake with comparable magnitude (M7.1) that occurred in Ridgecrest, California (USA) on 6 July of the same year but in a different tectonic context. Both earthquakes showed anomalies in several parameters (e.g. aerosol, skin temperature and some ionospheric quantities) that appeared at almost the same times before each earthquake occurrence, evidencing a chain of processes that collectively point to the moment of the corresponding mainshock.

The proposed method is computationally efficient and does not require any a priori information from wave or atmospheric models, as is usually the case with other approaches. It is also comparatively less sensitive to low signal-to-noise ratio image spectra, which in general hinders the disambig-uation of the retrieved directional wave spectrum. Several test cases were computed employing a simulator of complex SAR image spectra considering a broad range of values of steepness for the Envisat and Sentinel-1 satellite configurations. The results of the simulated cases were employed as lookup tables to correct biases while retrieving directional wave spectra from Level 1 cross spectra. As the nonlinearities, not accounted for when applying a linear inversion, are dependent on satellite configuration and on the relative position of the peak wave spectrum in relation to the azimuth cut-off, it is possible to quantify them through numerical sim-ulations. The SAR wave spectra retrieved with the Linear Inversion Method from an Envisat ground track were evaluated against the ECMWF reanalysis ERA5 and compared to the results of ESA Level 2 WVW wave mode spectra. The SAR-inverted wave spectra, retrieved with both methods, presented similar results in terms of root -mean-square error (RMSE) and scatter index (SI) for significant wave height, peak wavelength and peak prop-agation direction. Specifically for significant wave height, the Linear Inversion Method yielded a bias of-0.14 m, a SI of 0.34 and a RMSE of 0.44 m for a segment of ground track over the Pacific Ocean employed in our val-idations. The directional wave spectra retrieved with the Linear Inversion Method presented better similarity with the ERA5 spectra, in comparison with the WVW spectra. Moreover, in around one third of the cases, the ESA method did not resolve the directional ambiguity. The preliminary results employing the Linear Inversion Method are encouraging, specially considering its simplicity and performance against the ESA distributed wave spectra.', '[Brasil-Correa, Yuri O.; Violante-Carvalho, Nelson; Santos, Felipe M.; Costa, Leonardo P.

Satellite datasets successfully resolve the large scale SSS pattern but are significantly biased near the western boundary regions. Freshwater flux induced by sea ice formation/melting plays a dominant role in shaping the SSS annual cycle in the coastal regions of the western Labrador Sea, but data gaps and uncertainties prevent satellite products from accurately resolving the seasonality in the Labrador Shelf. On the other hand, seasonal fluctuations near the Grand Banks are reasonably captured in satellite data. They are essentially driven by both local freshwater flux associated with ice and advective signals from the north. The interannual variability of SSS is detectable in both in-situ observations and Aquarius. During the low salinity period in 2011-2012, interannual anomalies are no longer controlled by ice formation/melting. Instead, they are mostly determined by oceanic advection, which moves low salinity water around the Labrador Sea in a cyclonic direction. In addition, the Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Function (DINEOF) is applied to satellite datasets to weed out noise and fill data gaps. The resulting reconstructed datasets show apparent bias reduction and better performances in depicting seasonal cycles in both coastal region and deep ocean. DINEOF does not improve the capability of SMAP and SMOS in resolving the interannual anomalies as their original fields do not include such signals.', '[Hu, Rou] Ocean Univ China, Frontier Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth S, Qingdao, Peoples R China.

Standard remote sensing methods for N assessment typically involve the use of chlorophyll-sensitive vegetation indices calculated from multi -spectral or hyperspectral reflectance data. However, the chlorophyll a + b derived from spectral indices is indirectly related to leaf N and saturates at high leaf N levels, dramatically reducing the sensitivity with leaf N under these conditions. Furthermore, these relationships are heavily influenced by canopy structure, variability in leaf area density, proportion of sunlit-shaded tree-crown components, soil background, and understory. Recent studies in uniform crops have demonstrated that estimation of plant N can be improved by considering leaf biochemical constituents derived from radiative transfer model (RTM) and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF). However, it is unclear whether these methods are transferable to tree crops due to their intrinsic physiological differences, structural complexity, and within-tree crown heterogeneity. We investigated how various hyper -spectrally derived proxies for leaf N, including RTM-based traits and SIF, could be combined to assess N status on a 1200-ha almond orchard across two growing seasons. RTM-based chlorophyll a + b content (C-ab) and SIF were found to be the most important and consistent predictors for leaf N compared to other leaf biochemical and biophysical traits. C-ab alone was a modest predictor of leaf N variability (r(2) = 0.49, RMSE = 0.16%, p-value < 0.001), but when the non-collinear SIF and C-ab traits were coupled together, predictions improved dramatically (r(2) = 0.95, RMSE = 0.05%, p-value < 0.001). Leaf area index (LAI) was poorly associated with leaf N, suggesting that leaf physiological traits may be more important than structural traits in quantifying leaf N in well-managed orchards characterized by high N levels. Consistent results across the 2 years suggests the importance of airborne SIF coupled with Cab for precision agriculture and leaf N status assessment in almond orchards.', '[Wang, Y.; Suarez, L.; Poblete, T.; Ryu, D.; Zarco-Tejada, P.

It is a key variable in characterizing exchange processes between the atmosphere and land surface. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) provides unprecedented detail of the 3D structure of forest canopies. Yet, signal occlusion and uneven sampling density of the TLS point clouds limit our capacity to characterize the 3D distribution of canopy components. Recent studies have made use of statistical estimators of PAD that are applied to TLS point clouds subdivided into three-dimensional (3D) cubes, or voxels. Computation of such metrics under actual field conditions with point clouds containing several millions of returns is challenging. Moreover, rigorous assessment of the estimated PAD and effects of occlusions in forests remain unclear due to laborious, time-consuming, and inaccurate field measurements. In the present study, we present L-Vox, a software that computes PAD per voxel for TLS scans acquired in forest environments, which is based upon recent development of unbiased estimators derived from maximum likelihood. Two applications are presented. First, the software is evaluated for virtual forest plots, which are detailed 3D models of individual trees with corresponding simulated TLS scans, for which reference data are known. Second, L-Vox is applied to actual scans that were acquired in hardwood and coniferous plots in New Brunswick and Newfoundland, Canada. Both test cases were used to investigate the effects of occlusion and the uneven sampling in estimating PAD. The test cases were also used to assess the influence of voxel size and the number of scans per plot on PAD estimates. Our results showed strong correlations between the estimated PAD profile from L-Vox and simulated PAD for virtual forest plots, with a mean R2 = 0.98 and a mean coefficient of variation (CV) = 15.6%. We demonstrated that comparing multi-scan to single scan TLS acquisitions in real forest plots substantially reduced signal occlusion, resulting in an increase up to 50% in PAD values. Effects of voxel size on PAD estimates greatly depended upon the relative size of foliar and woody elements, with an optimal size around 10 cm in coniferous plots. L-Vox proved to be an efficient and accurate tool for computing 3D distributions of PAD from TLS measurements in natural forest environments.', '[Nguyen, Van-Tho; Fournier, Richard A.] Univ Sherbrooke, Ctr Applicat & Rech Teledetect CARTEL, Dept Appl Geomatics, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.

Soot deposition also induces algal growth, which further decreases snow and ice albedo. In recent years, increasingly severe and widespread wildfire activity has occurred in western Canada in association with climate change. In the summers of 2017 and 2018, westerly winds transported smoke from extensive record-breaking wildfires in British Columbia eastward to the Canadian Rockies, where substantial amounts of soot were deposited on high mountain glaciers, snowfields, and icefields. Several studies have addressed the problem of soot deposition on snow and ice, but the spatiotemporal resolution applied has not been compatible with studying mountain icefields that are extensive but contain substantial internal variability and have dynamical albedos. This study evaluates spatial patterns in the albedo decrease and net shortwave radiation (K*) increase caused by soot from intense wildfires in Western Canada deposited on the Columbia Icefield (151 km(2)), Canadian Rockies, during 2017 and 2018. Twelve Sentinel-2 images were used to generate high spatial resolution albedo retrievals during four summers (2017 to 2020) using a MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model, which was employed to model the snow and ice reflectance anisotropy. Remote sensing estimates were evaluated using site-measured albedo on the icefield\'s Athabasca Glacier tongue, resulting in a R-2, mean bias, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.68, 0.019, and 0.026, respectively. The biggest inter-annual spatially averaged soot-induced albedo declines were of 0.148 and 0.050 (2018 to 2020) for southeast-facing glaciers and the snow plateau, respectively. The highest inter-annual spatially-averaged soot-induced shortwave radiative forcing was 203 W/m(2) for southeast-facing glaciers (2018 to 2020) and 106 W/m(2) for the snow plateau (2017 to 2020). These findings indicate that snow albedo responded rapidly to and recovered rapidly from soot deposition. However, ice albedo remained low the year after fire, and this was likely related to a bio-albedo feedback involving microorganisms. Snow and ice K* were highest during low albedo years, especially for south-facing glaciers. These large-scale effects accelerated melt of the Columbia Icefield. The findings highlight the importance of using large-area high spatial resolution albedo estimates to analyze the effect of wildfire soot deposition on snow and ice albedo and K* on icefields, which is not possible using other approaches.', '[Bertoncini, Andre; Aubry-Wake, Caroline; Pomeroy, John W.] Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, 116A-1151 Sidney St, Canmore, AB T1W 3G1, Canada.', 'University of SaskatchewanRP Bertoncini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, 116A-1151 Sidney St, Canmore, AB T1W 3G1, Canada.', 'andre.bertoncini@usask.caRI Pomeroy, John W/IZE-0873-2023', 'Pomeroy, John W/0000-0002-4782-7457', 'Canada Research Chairs programme; Natural Sciences and Engineering   Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Alberta Innovates; Canada First   Research Excellence Fund\'s (CFREF) Global Water Futures programme', 'We wish to thank the European Space Agency (ESA), NASA, USGS, Google   Earth Engine (GEE), and Alberta Agriculture and Forestry\'s ACIS for   providing this study\'s data and cloud computing.

Methods to distinguish this internal diversity are still rare, especially in boreal forests. This research therefore aims to determine the ability of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) technology to identify age-related structural diversity in old-growth boreal forests. The study area was located in primary boreal forests in Quebec (Canada) dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana). This area contained 71.8 km(2) of early old-growth forests (burned 110 years ago), 17.1 km2 of late old-growth forests (protected areas; unburned for at least 250 years) and 370 km(2) of old-growth forests of unknown age (> 125-years-old). We divided the study area into 1 ha tiles, where we extracted seven ALS indices representing vertical and horizontal forest structure. We trained random forest models using an iterative approach to discriminate between early and late old-growth forests based on ALS indices. Model predictions were applied to the old-growth tiles of unknown age, and to 86 field plots (28 from provincial forest surveys and 58 from a dedicated survey of old-growth forests) to evaluate the predictive capacity of the models. The models very accurately distinguished early and late old-growth forests (error-rate = 4.9%). Old-growth survey plots confirmed model ability to discriminate early and late old-growth forests, but not provincial survey plots, possibly because of a lower reliability of these data when forest age exceeds 150 years. Model predictions for tiles of unknown age highlighted the presence of very large tracts of late old-growth forests within a matrix of old-growth forests of intermediate age (asymptotic to 150-200 years). Overall, ALS-data can contribute to a finer structural age distinction and mapping of boreal old-growth forests. This enhanced knowledge of old-growth landscapes will greatly help to improve their protection, restoration and management. The scarcity of reliable field data for model evaluation is, however, a limitation to be addressed.', '[Martin, Maxence; Valeria, Osvaldo] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Inst Rech Forets, 445 boul Univ, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada.

However, urbanization and its evolution process, i.e., conversions among diverse land covers, are hard to measure, as existing land cover maps usually have low temporal resolutions; conversely, long-term and temporally dense land cover maps, such as vegetation-impervious-soil decomposition maps base on MODIS, ignore the important land cover of cropland in urban evolution process (UEP). To resolve the issue, this study suggests a novel model named time extended non-crop vegetation-impervious-cropland (Time V-I-C) to represent and quantify different stages of UEP; then, a normalized multi-objective T-ConvLSTM (NMT) method is proposed to unmix cropland, non-crop vegetation, and impervious based on the intra-annual remotely-sensed time series, and obtain their fractions in each pixel for generating UEP maps. Consequently, UEP maps from 2001 to 2018 are generated for two Chinese urban agglomerations, i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations. The mapping results have high accuracies with a small standard error of regression (SER) of 13.1%, small root mean square error (RMSE) of 12.6%, and small mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.4%, and the maps reveal the different UEP in the two urban agglomerations.

Radiative transfer (RT) models for simulating scattering and (re-) absorption of SIF provide a powerful tool to study the upscaling of SIF signal from leaf level to terrestrial ecosystems. Based on the Monte Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) model, WPS (Weighted Photon Spread), we made major extensions with new functionalities and systematic evaluation of the new modules. By modeling the radiative coupling between atmosphere and land surface with the same MCRT method, the non-fluorescent and SIF radiance received by sensors can be simulated at levels from top-of canopy to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) in a coherent manner. New extension to represent the three-dimensional (3-D) canopies with geometrical primitives composed of turbid medium makes the hyperspectral simulation (especially SIF) for a sensor with medium spatial resolution at kilometer-scale feasible and practical. Evaluations through ROMC (Radiation transfer model intercomparison Online Model Checker) show that the accuracy of the new module of 3-D structure representation in WPS is within 1% of the reference solution. The spectra of TOA radiance and SIF and their components simulated at nadir by WPS agree closely with those simulated by the coupled SCOPE and MODTRAN models with the coefficient of determination (R-2) higher than 0.99 and the average absolute relative error (AARE) lower than 6.39%; for angular distributions of TOA radiance and SIF at 685 nm and 740 nm, R-2 is higher than 0.81 and AARE is lower than 6.94%. Comparisons of the spectra of TOA radiance and SIF and their components simulated at nadir by WPS and the DART model give R-2 higher than 0.99 and AARE lower than 3.5%; R-2 is higher than 0.92 and AARE is lower than 5.92% for the TOA angular simulations. The WPS model was also evaluated by hyperspectral measurements through unmanned aerial vehicle at different altitudes, which shows that WPS can reproduce the spectral features of a rapeseed crop. WPS can be used as a versatile tool to assess the impacts of various factors on the SIF signal and to evaluate the SIF retrieval methods under different conditions.', '[Zhao, Feng; Li, Zhenjiang; Fan, Chongrui; Luan, Hexuan] Beihang Univ, Sch Instrumentat Sci & Optoelect Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.

The volume of imagery available for such measurements is rapidly growing but the exploitation of these data is challenging due to the various sources of geometric distortions of the satellite imagery. Here we propose a new approach to extract high-quality surface displacement in 3D based on the correlation of multi-date and multi-platform high resolution optical imagery. We additionally show that when a large enough volume of data is available, it is possible to separate the deformation signal from the artifacts due to the satellite jitter and misalignment of the CCDs, which, together with topographic artifacts, are the main source of noise in the measurements. Our method makes use of a reference DEM, but the outcome is independent of the characteristics of the chosen DEM. We use the case-example of the ground deformation caused by the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence to assess the performance of our proposed approach. We show that it outperforms the more standard approach which combines 2-D correlation and DEM differencing.

Functional diversity of plant traits links ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. This work presents an approach to map and quantify functional diversity of physiological forest traits derived from 20 m Sentinel-2 data in a temperate forest ecosystem. We used two complementary data sources, namely high-resolution, as well as spatially resampled airborne imaging spectroscopy data and Sentinel-2 data, to ensure our methods support consistently mapping functional diversity from space. We retrieved three physiological traits related to forest health, stress, and potential productivity, namely chlorophyll, carotenoid, and water content, from airborne imaging spectroscopy and Sentinel-2 data using corresponding spectral indices as proxies. We analyzed changes in two functional diversity metrics, namely functional richness and divergence, at different spatial resolutions. Both functional diversity metrics depend on the size and number of pixels to derive functional diversity as a function of distance, leading to different interpretations. When mapping functional diversity using Sentinel-2 data, small-scale patterns <1.1 ha were no longer visible, implying a minimum calculation area with 60 m radius recommended for retrieval of functional diversity metrics. The spectrally convolved and spatially resampled airborne spectroscopy data and the native Sentinel-2 data were correlated with r = 0.747 for functional richness and r = 0.709 for divergence in a 3.1 ha neighborhood. Functional richness was more affected by the differences in trait maps between the acquisitions resulting from effects in illumination and topography compared with functional divergence.

As a response, international environmental agreements and related programs require information about tropical forested landscapes. Despite the increasing quantity and quality of remote sensing-based data, the effective monitoring of forests in the tropics still faces operational challenges: (a) applicability at local levels, with lack of reference or cloud-free information; (b) overcoming geographical, ecological, or biophysical variability; (c): stratification, distinguishing forest categories related to functionality and disturbance history. We conducted an extensive ground verification campaign through 36 landscapes in 9 regions of Zambia, Ecuador and Philippines, which constitute a gradient of pantropical deforestation contexts or forest transitions. We collected over 16,000 ground control points and digitized over 18,000 ha with details on land use and forest disturbance history. We trained a random forest algorithm and generated high-resolution (30 m) binary forest maps covering ~15 Mha, building on 39 optical (Landsat-8), radar (Sentinel-1) and elevation bands, indices and textures. We validated the quality of the outputs across the studied deforestation gradient and compared them to (a): 3 national land cover maps used for international reporting, (b): 4 global forest datasets (Global Forest Change, Copernicus Land Cover, JAXA and TanDEM-X Forest/Non-Forest). Our method generated highly accurate (92%) forest maps for the studied regions when compared to the global datasets, which generally overestimated forest cover. We achieved accuracies similar to the national maps, following a standardized method for all countries. The difficulties in delineating forest increased in more advanced stages of deforestation, with recurring struggles to distinguish non-forest tree-based systems (e.g. perennials, palms, or agroforestry), shrublands and grasslands. Regrowth forests were repeatedly misclassified across contexts, countries and datasets, in contrast to reference or degraded forests. Our results highlight the importance of in situ verification as accompanying method to establish efficient forest monitoring systems, especially in areas with higher rates of forest cover change and in tropical regions of advanced deforestation or early reforestation stages.

To that purpose, we designed a fast-computing end-to-end simulator including several components, which we implemented to simulate both pixel-size TRISHNA measurements and land surface temperature (LST) retrievals. Firstly, simulations were conducted over a wide range of realistic scenarii, notably by including vegetation canopy-scale cavity effect. Secondly, the experimental design included the features of second generation Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (MCT) cooled detectors with lower instrumental noises and finer channels. Thirdly, as opposed to previous studies that used predefined spectral configurations to determine the most suited one, we conducted an optimization of the spectral configuration by crossing, on a pair basis, several positions of the four TIR channels over a range of wavelengths. Fourthly, we quantified the TES sensitivity to atmospheric perturbations, by comparing LST retrievals with and without atmospheric noise. We observed an overall moderate sensitivity of TES LST retrievals to the spectral channel positions, with a maximum RMSE variation of 0.31 K within the atmospheric spectral windows. Furthermore, the TES method was sensitive to three main parameters, namely the instrumental noise, the atmospheric downwelling irradiance, and the transmittance due to ozone and water vapor, with RMSEs larger than 1 K for specific channel locations. Moreover, by considering possible superimposition of two channels, we noted that the TES method could achieve similar performance by considering three or four channels. Eventually, our study enabled us to recommend a new spectral configuration for the TRISHNA TIR instrument, that is more robust to atmospheric perturbations and to uncertainties on channel positions and bandwidths.', '[Vidal, Thomas H.

However, soil roughness complicates the relationship between brightness temperature and soil moisture, with current soil moisture retrieval algorithms typically assuming a constant roughness parameter globally, leading to a potential degradation in retrieval accuracy. This current investigation established a towerbased experiment site in Victoria, Australia. P-band (-40-cm wavelength/0.75 GHz) was compared with L-band (-21-cm wavelength/1.41 GHz) over random and periodic soil surfaces to determine if there is an improvement in brightness temperature simulation and soil moisture retrieval accuracy for bare soil conditions, due to reduced roughness impact when using a longer wavelength. The results showed that P-band was less impacted by random and periodic roughness than L-band, evidenced by more comparable statistics across different roughness conditions. The roughness effect from smooth surfaces (e.g., 0.8-cm root-mean-square height and 11.1-cm correlation length) could be potentially ignored at both P- and L-band with satisfactory simulation and retrieval performance. However, for rougher soil (e.g., 1.6-cm root-mean-square height and 6.8-cm correlation length), the roughness impact needed to be accounted for at both P- and L-band, with P-band observations showing less impact than L-band. Moreover, a sinusoidal soil surface with 10-cm amplitude and 80-cm period substantially impacted the brightness temperature simulation and soil moisture retrieval at both P- and L-band, which could not be fully accounted for using the SMOS and SMAP default roughness parameters. However, when retrieving roughness parameters along with soil moisture, the ubRMSE at P-band over periodic soil was improved to a similar level (0.01-0.02 m3/m3) as that of smooth flat soil (0.01 m3/m3), while L-band showed higher ubRMSE over the periodic soil (0.03-0.04 m3/m3) than over smooth flat soil (0.01 m3/m3). Accordingly, periodic roughness effects were reduced by using observations at P-band.', '[Shen, Xiaoji; Walker, Jeffrey P.; Ye, Nan; Wu, Xiaoling; Brakhasi, Foad; Boopathi, Nithyapriya; Zhu, Liujun] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic, Australia.

However, it has now become a growing ecological and economic threat in grasslands of several states in the U.S. southern Great Plains including Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. Here, we demonstrate the capability of airborne imaging spectroscopy to map sericea in a large natural grassland within the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, the largest protected tallgrass prairie in the world, located in northeastern Oklahoma. Through this research, we investigated which remotely observable vegetation functional traits (referring to biochemical, physiological, and structural traits) contribute to distinguishing sericea from cooccurring native species and whether we can detect sericea remotely through quantifying these functional traits using imaging spectroscopic data (also known as hyperspectral data). To achieve these objectives, full-range airborne hyperspectral data with spatial resolution of 1 m were collected from the study area in August 2020. In addition, a total of 12 vegetation functional traits were measured through field sampling for model development. We first identified functional traits that contributed to separating sericea from other species, and then used them in a classification model to detect sericea in our study site. We found total carotenoids (sum of neoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein), chlorophyll a + b (sum of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b), total nitrogen, canopy height, potassium, and magnesium as the main functional traits contributing to the detection of sericea; an overall classification accuracy of approximately 94% was reported. However, the proposed approach overestimated sericea cover in species-rich plant communities. Overall, our findings demonstrated an essential role for airborne remote sensing in 1) direct mapping of invasive plants and 2) quantifying functional traits associated with success strategies of invasive species. Eventually, experiments like ours can aid in developing large-scale and science-driven management practices to both identify the current extent, and to control the spread of invasive species in grasslands and similar short-stature environments. This will not only improve management practices but will have major societal and economic benefits.', '[Gholizadeh, Hamed; Hassani, Kianoosh] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Geog, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.

Altimetry-based water level time series of rivers are typically constructed at locations where the satellite ground tracks intersect the rivers, the so-called virtual stations. The relatively low sampling frequency (10-27 days) of the repeat missions may result in an under-sampling of the hydrological regime in rivers with sub-monthly to weekly events. We are currently in a unique position with more than a handful satellite altimetry missions simultaneously mapping the surface elevation of the Earth. In combination, these missions contain an unexploited potential to obtain a more detailed picture of the hydrological regime of many of the Earth\'s rivers. The task of combining water levels measured at different locations and/or by satellites with different orbits is however, challenging due to e.g. topography, intermission biases, variation in river morphology, and other unidentified causes. In this work, we present a new method to combine multi-mission altimetry-based water levels from a river reach. This will also enable the use of geodetic missions like CryoSat-2 and SARAL/AltiKa (after June 2016) in water level time series. To combine the data we set up a state-space model where the process part is a first-order autoregressive process. The observations as a function of time and distance along the reach are described as a sum of the water level at a given time scaled by a distance-dependent factor, the mean water level at the given distance, and an error term. The scale factor and the mean water level are modeled with spline functions. We employ the model for the six rivers Lena, Solimo similar to es, Mississippi, Danube, Po, and Red, which range in width from 3 km to a few hundred meters. For each river, we consider a reach of 200-300 km and apply water levels from the satellite altimetry missions CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3A/3B, and SARAL/AltiKa. The selected reach must have a continuous elevation profile and preferable no major tributaries, which might alter the hydrological regime considerably. The length of the reach is a compromise of ensuring enough data but not violating the aforementioned criteria. When validated against in situ data we find a root mean square error ranging from 0.34 m (Solimo similar to es River) to 2.53 m (Lena River) and a correlation ranging from 0.83 (Danube River) to 0.99 (Solimo similar to es River). These summary statistics are based on approximately 2000-3000 pairs of in situ and modeled water levels. We find the largest increase in detail for the reconstructed water levels for the Danube, Po, and Red Rivers, where the water level variations are under-sampled at the virtual stations. For the Po River, we can detect sub-weekly events with the model and for the Lena River, the spring flood related to ice and snowmelt is better captured when combining the data. An additional advantage of the approach is that the water level time series can be reconstructed at all locations along the considered reach.', '[Nielsen, Karina; Andersen, Ole B.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Space Inst, Lyngby, Denmark.

Phenology of S. alterniflora saltmarshes is a critical feature to elucidate the invasion dynamics over geographical regions but has not been well understood yet. In this study, we examined the variation of S. alterniflora saltmarsh phenology across coastal China during 2018-2020 by using time series Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 images. Combined Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 images provided more good-quality observations in a year, which could facilitate phenological retrieval. We applied and assessed three widely used phenology retrieval methods (i.e., NDVI-based pixel-specific statistical threshold, NDVI-based double logistic mathematical equation, and LSWI-based biological threshold) for retrieving the start and end of season (SOS and EOS) as well as the length of season (LOS) of S. alterniflora saltmarshes. The SOS and EOS dates derived from three phenology retrieval methods showed similar patterns in latitudinal phenology variation: SOS became later and LOS became shorter as latitude increased, and the latitudinal trend of EOS was not as large as that of SOS. This study shows the potential of Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 to quantify land surface phenology of S. alterniflora saltmarshes, which not only enhances our understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of coastal saltmarshes in China but also improves the management of this plant invader that threatens native saltmarshes in the world.', '[Zhang, Xi; Qiu, Shiyun; Xu, Xiao; Wang, Xinxin; Wu, Jihua; Li, Bo] Fudan Univ, Inst Biodivers Sci, Natl Observat & Res Stn Wetland Ecosyst Yangtze E, Minist Educ,Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.

Time series of historic satellite data (e.g. Landsat) have resulted in an invaluable record of changes in forest conditions. Natural resource management and reporting typically operate at an annual time step, yet the recent addition of data streams from compatible satellites (e.g., Sentinel-2) offer the possibility of generating frequent, management-relevant forest status assessments and maps of change. Analytical approaches that rely on a time series of observations to identify change often struggle to provide reliable estimates of change events in terminal years of the time series until subsequent, additional observations are available. Methods to meaningfully integrate observations from compatible satellite platforms can provide short-term information to augment and refine estimates of change area and type in those terminal years of the time series. In this research we fuse Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A and -2B data streams to capture, with reduced latency, stand replacing forest change (harvest and wildfire), tagged to a temporal window of occurrence over an similar to 10,000 km(2) area of central British Columbia, Canada. We introduce a new algorithm, SLIMS (Shrinking Latency in Multiple Streams), to rapidly and reliably detect change, and then use an established Bayesian approach to meaningfully combine changes detected in the Landsat and Sentinel data streams. Our results indicate that the type and timing of stand-replacing disturbances can be identified in these forests with high accuracy. Overall, 13.9% of the study area was disturbed between the end of 2016 and the end of 2017, with the majority of disturbed area attributable to wildfire and a smaller amount attributed to forest harvesting, mostly in the winter 2016-2017 with some limited summer harvest also occurring. Overall accuracy of the change, assessed using independent validation data, was 95% +/- 2.3%. The capacity of these change results to augment a trend-based assessment of change for 2017 was also demonstrated and provides a framework for how short- and long-term change detection approaches provide complementary information that can increase the timeliness and accuracy of change area estimates in the terminal years of a time series. These findings also demonstrate the capacity to regard Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors as elements of a virtual constellation to obtain forest change information in a timely (i.e., end of growing season) and reliable fashion over large areas.', '[Cardille, Jeffrey A.; Perez, Elijah; Crowley, Morgan A.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.

Current satellite retrieved LSTs are mainly validated over a few homogeneous sites. However, most of the existing ground sites are located in inhomogeneous areas: thus, their spatial representativeness on satellite pixel scales is unknown. In this situation, how to evaluate the spatial representativeness of these inhomogeneous sites, quantify the influence introduced by the spatial representativeness and describe the variation of the site\'s spatial representativeness are critical questions for satellite LST validation. In an attempt to answer those questions, a so-called temporal variation method (TVM) is proposed for evaluating a ground site\'s spatial representativeness. The method defines a spatial representativeness indicator (SRI), which is the LST difference between a ground radiometer\'s field-ofview (FOV) and a satellite pixel, and describes a site\'s spatial representativeness. Based on the temporal variation of LST, the SRI time series consists of three temporal components: increment ATC, increment DTCF-P, and increment USC, which describe the annual, diurnal, and instantaneous variations of SRI, respectively. Associated with the Landsat TM/ETM+ data and weather parameters, the method is implemented and tested at 16 Chinese ground sites for the validation of MODIS and AATSR LST products. Results show that the temporally continuous SRI (SRITPR) shows high correlations with the original SRI (SRIORI). The variation of SRITPR is mainly determined by changes in surface coverage (i.e. NDVI difference on the two scales) and affected by weather conditions (e.g. near-surface air temperature, accumulative downward solar radiation, and wind speed). Since the SRI is defined as the LST difference between the two scales, it can be used as a bridge to convert the in-situ LST to pixel scale to address the spatial scale mismatch in LST validation. With this idea, the in-situ LST at daytime was converted to pixel scale associated with the SRITPR, and the corresponding MODIS and AATSR LST were validated at the 16 ground sites. Results for MODIS and AATSR LST show that the effect of spatial representativeness on the validation results over the sites is large, with mean biases between -1.95 K and 5.60 K and standard deviations between 0.07 K and 3.72 K. Since the TVM method does not rely on a specific satellite or land surface product, it is readily applied to other LST products (e.g. Sentinel-3 SLSTR LST, NOAA VIIRS LST) and surface parameters (e.g. surface longwave radiation).', '[Ma, Jin; Zhou, Ji; Zhang, Xiaodong; Wang, Shaofei; Li, Mingsong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Ctr Informat Geosci, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.

These radiative transfer models are parameterized by a wide range of quantities, ranging from observation and solar geometries to assumptions about atmospheric conditions, including vertical distributions aerosols and water vapor as well as the atmospheric composition. However, current retrieval approaches cannot represent this variability; they are limited by computational expense to a coarsely-spaced look up table (LUT) of just a few parameters. Here, we propose a new method called sRTMnet that facilitates the efficient creation of dense LUT grids that fully capture radiative transfer\'s inherent nonlinearity. sRTMnet uses a combination of fast, reduced-order radiative transfer modeling coupled with neural-network-based emulation to realize a computational speedup of over 3000x while maintaining the accuracy of a high-fidelity RTM. We demonstrate the accuracy of sRTMnet in multiple ways. We show that neural-network-based emulation delivers accurate atmospheric properties using robust testing sets. We then use acquisitions from the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer - next generation (AVIRIS-NG) to show near identical surface reflectance estimates with sRTMnet and a high-fidelity radiative transfer model (MODTRAN). Finally, we show how distributions of mapped minerals remain consistent when using the sRTMnet-based reflectance. Given these results, sRTMnet will be utilized for the upcoming Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT, an imaging spectrometer destined for the international space station in 2022). In addition to speed and accuracy, the fully open-source nature of sRTMnet (including simulation and emulation), provides a pathway for high-resolution imaging spectroscopy reflectance retrievals at the global scale.', '[Brodrick, Philip G.; Thompson, David R.; Fahlen, Jay E.; Eastwood, Michael L.; Sarture, Charles M.; Lundeen, Sarah R.; Olson-Duvall, Winston; Carmon, Nimrod; Green, Robert O.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.', 'California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space   Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)RP Brodrick, PG (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.', 'philip.brodrick@jpl.nasa.govRI Brodrick, Philip G/B-4496-2015; Thompson, David/C-3520-2008', 'Brodrick, Philip/0000-0001-9497-7661', 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Science   Division; Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT), a NASA   Earth VenturesInstrument (EVI-4) Mission; US Government; National   Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'We thank the members of the AVIRIS-NG team who participated in data   acquisition and analysis.

(2009a) (Z09), each with a different set of quality checking and spatiotemporal collocation criteria. The question remains what sort of information is added or missed when choosing one over the other. In this work, the differences among validation approaches were determined by using a common dataset of in situ and satellite data. The match-up exercise was separated into two groups of datasets based on the spatial resolution of the sensors to be validated. Sentinel-3A/OLCI data were selected as a representation of medium spatial resolution sensors, and two validation approaches were selected to this matchup dataset. The high spatial resolution sensors were represented by Sentinel-2A/MSI data, and three validation approaches were tested. Data from the AERONET-OC network were chosen as the common in situ dataset. For Sentinel-3A/OLCI, the number of match-ups varies depending on the validation approach used. Bailey and Werdell (2006) produces 20% more match-ups for Sentinel-3A/OLCI due to its more relaxed filtering criteria compared to the criteria applied by Zibordi et al. (2009a). The validation metrics vary between different validation methods giving a different impression of accuracy of the satellite products. Also, the satellite data selected by BW06 have a statistical distribution with a higher median and standard deviation when compared to Z09. Similar findings are also confirmed for the match-up analysis conducted for Sentinel-2A/MSI. Therefore, although a common reference dataset was used, the validation statistical results were influenced by the validation approach selected. This does not suggest that one validation protocol is better than the other, but it implies that validation statistics reported in different studies may not always be directly comparable.

Combination of remote sensing techniques and local maximum (LM) filtering algorithm provides a feasible approach to individual tree crown detection, but still faces high error under complicate canopy structure. In this study, a revised LM (RLM) algorithm is presented and evaluated for identifying individual trees from four high spatial-resolution images. Instead of a moving window technique, the RLM algorithm finds crown center seeds by searching local maximal in the transects along row and column directions of the image. Each of final crown centers is then searched using a variable window centered at the crown center seed. Strategies for splitting and merging crowns are implemented in the RLM algorithm to reduce false detection. Result showed that accuracy of the RLM algorithm was more sensitive to its minimum crown length parameter (CLmin). The RLM algorithm driven by the CLmin estimates achieved high overall accuracies between 85% and 91% and low commission (9?14%) and omission errors (8?15%) for the four images. Splitting and merging strategies implemented in the RLM algorithm effectively reduced commission and omission errors.

Here, we implemented an independent component analysis-based inversion method to investigate water storage changes and hydrometeorological extremes (e.g., heavy precipitation and droughts) in Yunnan. Our time-varying inversion allows us to reproduce the spatiotemporal evolution of terrestrial water storage changes. Three independent components (ICs) were chosen in our time-varying inversion model. The first two ICs contribute to 96.9% and 2.1% of data variance, respectively, and reveal annual water storage changes at different temporal scales. The third IC slightly explains the network time series and possibly correlates with the nonlinear water changes. The averaged GNSS, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) based multi-annual seasonal water changes have good consistency in their spatiotemporal signatures. All datasets suggest a gradually increasing trend in seasonal water storage variations from northeast to southwest Yunnan. The peak annual amplitudes of similar to 355 mm in the GNSS-inferred water estimates are larger than those of similar to 167-226 mm derived from the GLDAS and GRACE models. Hydrometeorological extremes are tracked in the various water time series, and GNSS-derived water deficits contribute to hydrological drought characterization. We also find good agreement between daily precipitation anomalies, GNSS-, and GLDAS-based water changes during the 2015 winter rainstorm.

We use London as a case study for three selected outputs, each measured in decile classes: income, overcrowding, and environmental deprivation. We compare the performances of our proposed multimodal models to corresponding unimodal ones using mean absolute error (MAE). First, satellite tiles are appended to street level imagery to enhance predictions at locations where street images are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 20, 10, and 9% in units of decile classes for income, overcrowding, and living environment. The second approach, novel to the best of our knowledge, uses a U-Net architecture to make predictions for all grid cells in a city at high spatial resolution (e.g. for 3 m ? 3 m pixels in London in our experiments). It can utilize city wide availability of satellite images as well as more sparse information from street level images where they are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 6, 10, and 11%.

The current and future missions can benefit from investigations that seek to improve retrieval algorithms that quantitatively map global soil moisture and vegetation optical depth (tau) from Earth\'s microwave emissions. In this study, we explore multi-angular and multi-frequency approaches for the retrieval of soil moisture and vegetation tau, considering the payload configurations of current and future satellite missions (such as the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer, the Water Cycle Observation Mission, and the Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite) using a new set of ground observations. Two ground-based microwave radiometry datasets collected in Inner Mongolia during the Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River from July to August 2017 (cropland) and August to September 2018 (grassland) are used for this study. The corn field, which covers an entire growth period, indicated that the degree of information increases linearly as the number of channels (in terms of the incidence angle and frequency) increases, and that the multi-frequency observations contain slightly more independent information than do the multi-angular observations under the same number of channels. The polarization difference in brightness temperature is sensitive to both soil moisture and vegetation water content, especially at L-band due to its penetrating ability. Soil moisture explains most of the variance in frequency differences of brightness temperature at adjacent frequencies (L- & C-bands, C- & X-bands), while the variance in incidence-angle differences of brightness temperature is mostly associated with the vegetation water content. A multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA) is developed based on the two-component version of the omega-tau model, which utilizes information from collaborative channels expressed as an analytical form of brightness temperature at the core channel to rule out the parameters to be retrieved. Results of soil moisture retrieval show that the multi-angular approach used by the MCCA generally has a better performance, unbiased mot mean square difference (ubRMSD) varying from 0.028 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.037 cm(3)/cm(3), than the multi-frequency approach (ubRMSD from 0.028 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.089 cm(3)/cm(3)) for the corn field. This is attributed to the dependence of vegetation tau on the frequency being more significant than that on the incidence angle. Except for in the C- & X-band combination, the multi-frequency approach used by the MCCA performs better (ubRMSD from 0.018 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.023 cm(3)/cm(3)) than the multi-angular version (ubRMSD from 0.026 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.034 cm(3)/cm(3)) for the grass field due to reduced vegetation effects for this type of cover. It is affirmed that increasing the number of observation channels could make the soil moisture retrieval more robust, but might also limit the retrieval performance, as the probability that the model estimations will not match the observations is increased. This study provides new insights into the design of potential satellite missions to improve soil moisture retrieval.

Optical satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) allow for the monitoring of lake ice cover (an Essential Climate Variable or ECV), and dates associated with ice phenology (freeze-up, break-up, and ice cover duration) over large areas in an era where ground-based observational networks have nearly vanished in many northern countries. Ice phenology dates as well as dates of maximum and minimum ice cover extent (for lakes that do not form a complete ice cover in winter or do not totally lose their ice cover in summer) are useful for assessing long-term trends and variability in climate, particularly due to their sensitivity to changes in near-surface air temperature. Existing knowledge-driven (threshold-based) retrieval algorithms for lake ice cover mapping that use top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance products do not perform well under lower solar illumination conditions (i.e. large solar zenith angles), resulting in low TOA reflectance. This research assessed the capability of four machine learning classifiers (i.e. multinomial logistic regression, MLR; support vector machine, SVM; random forest, RF; gradient boosting trees, GBT) for mapping lake ice cover, water and cloud cover during both break-up and freeze-up periods using the MODIS/Terra L1B TOA (MOD02) product. The classifiers were trained and validated using samples collected from 17 large lakes across the Northern Hemisphere (Europe and North America); lakes that represent different characteristics with regards to area, latitude, freezing frequency, and ice duration. Following an accuracy assessment using random k-fold cross-validation (k = 100), all machine learning classifiers using a 7-band combination (visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared) were found to be able to produce overall classification accuracies above 94%. Both RF and GBT provided overall and class-specific accuracies above 98% and a more visually accurate depiction of lake ice, water and cloud cover. The two tree-based classifiers offered the most robust spatial transferability over the 17 lakes and performed consistently well across ice seasons. However, only RF was relatively insensitive to the choice of the hyperparameters compared to the other three classifiers. The results demonstrate the potential of RF for mapping lake ice cover globally from MODIS TOA reflectance data.', '[Wu, Yuhao; Duguay, Claude R.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.

In this study, a large in-situ dataset acquired in inland, estuarine and coastal waters of the nGoM and U.S. East Coast were utilized to achieve a regional parameterization of the red-NIR ratio-based chlorophyll a (Chl a) algorithm for the high-spatial and spectral resolution Sentinel 3-OLCI ocean color sensor. Using an adaptive scheme, the algorithm was used in combination with other standard Chl a algorithms such as the Neural Network (C2RCC) and OC4ME to optimally extract Chl a in water types ranging from turbid estuarine to clear oceanic waters in the nGoM. This adaptive methodology (Chl a_AD) showed better performance in estimating OLCI-Chl a (R-2=0.84, N = 178) compared to any single algorithm in the estuarine-coastal-ocean waters of the nGoM. Next, OLCI-derived phytoplankton spectral absorption coefficients (OLCI-a(phy)) were obtained for comparison, using a regionally-tuned 3rd order function of OLCI-Chl a based on Multi-regression (MR), and an estuarine-to-ocean adaptive Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA-AD). Finally, an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) algorithm was applied to OLCI-aphy to retrieve phytoplankton size fractions (PSFs) for the river dominated nGoM region. Results indicate relatively better performance of MR-EOF in estimating f(micro) (R-2=0.87), f(nano)(R-2=0.76) and f(pico)(R-2=0.64) compared to QAA-AD-EOF. Chl a time-series (Oct 2016 - Jan 2020) obtained in the estuaries and shelf waters of the nGoM revealed seasonality (peak/lows in spring/fall) linked to river discharge, where hydrodynamics and wind driven variability due to storms further influenced the phytoplankton biomass spatiotemporal distribution. Microphytoplankton dominated in estuaries and the nGOM inner shelf waters, including the midshelf region during the spring peak river discharge period. PSF dynamics in the outer shelf is strongly influenced by Loop Current eddies where warm offshore waters contribute to the dominance of the picophytoplankton fraction. Floodwater discharge and strong winds due to Hurricane Barry (2019) transported estuarine microphytoplankton into the outer shelf and also increased nanophytoplankton fraction. Such fluctuations in phytoplankton size structure after hurricanes or storms can modify the pelagic food web dynamics in coastal systems.', '[Liu, Bingqing; D\'Sa, Eurico J.; Maiti, Kanchan; Rivera-Monroy, Victor H.; Xue, Zuo] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.

Satellite remote sensing allows for generating spatially continuous PM2.5 data, but current datasets have overall low accuracies with coarse spatial resolutions limited by data sources and models. Air pollution levels in China have experienced dramatic changes over the past couple of decades. However, country-wide ground-based PM2.5 records only date back to 2013. To reveal the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5, long-term and high-spatialresolution aerosol optical depths, generated by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Multi-Angle implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, were employed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations at a 1 km resolution using our proposed Space-Time Extra-Trees (STET) model. Our model can capture well variations in PM2.5 concentrations at different spatiotemporal scales, with higher accuracies (i.e., cross-validation coefficient of determination, CV-R-2 = 0.86-0.90) and stronger predictive powers (i.e., R-2 = 0.80-0.82) than previously reported. The resulting PM2.5 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM(2.5)) provides the longest record (i.e., 2000 to 2018) at a high spatial resolution of 1 km, enabling the study of PM2.5 variation patterns at different scales. In most places, PM2.5 concentrations showed increasing trends around 2007 and remained high until 2013, after which they declined substantially, thanks to a series of government actions combating air pollution in China. While nationwide PM2.5 concentrations have decreased by 0.89 mu g/m(3)/yr (p < 0.001) during the last two decades, the reduction has accelerated to 4.08 mu g/m(3)/yr (p < 0.001) over the last six years, indicating a significant improvement in air quality. Large improvements occurred in the Pearl and Yangtze River Deltas, while the most polluted region remained the North China Plain, especially in winter.

By quantifying the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and underlying terrain using laser technology, ALS has been used extensively for enhancing geospatial knowledge in the fields of forestry and ecology. Structural descriptions of vegetation provide a means of estimating a range of ecologically pertinent attributes, such as height, volume, and above-ground biomass. The efficient processing of large, often technically complex datasets requires dedicated algorithms and software. The continued promise of ALS as a tool for im-proving ecological understanding is often dependent on user-created tools, methods, and approaches. Due to the proliferation of ALS among academic, governmental, and private-sector communities, paired with requirements to address a growing demand for open and accessible data, the ALS community is recognising the importance of free and open-source software (FOSS) and the importance of user-defined workflows. Herein, we describe the philosophy behind the development of the lidR package. Implemented in the R environment with a C/C++ backend, lidR is free, open-source and cross-platform software created to enable simple and creative processing workflows for forestry and ecology communities using ALS data. We review current algorithms used by the research community, and in doing so raise awareness of current successes and challenges associated with parameterisation and common implementation approaches. Through a detailed description of the package, we address the key considerations and the design philosophy that enables users to implement user-defined tools. We also discuss algorithm choices that make the package representative of the \'state-of-the-art\' and we highlight some internal limitations through examples of processing time discrepancies. We conclude that the development of applications like lidR are of fundamental importance for developing transparent, flexible and open ALS tools to ensure not only reproducible workflows, but also to offer researchers the creative space required for the progress and development of the discipline.', '[Roussel, Jean-Romain; Achim, Alexis] Univ Laval, Dept Sci & Foret, Ctr Rech Mat Renouvelables, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.

To remove thick clouds from Landsat data, the most popular methods employ auxiliary data such as a cloud-free image of the same area acquired on another date (referred to as the \"reference image\"). However, the performance of most previous methods strongly depends on the usefulness of the specific reference image, but in some cases high-quality cloud-free reference images are rarely available. In addition, some of these methods ignore the use of partially cloud-contaminated reference images, but clear pixels in these images can be very useful. To address these issues, a new cloud-removal method (AutoRegression to Remove Clouds (ARRC)) has been developed in this study. The most important improvement of ARRC is that it considers autocorrelation of Landsat time-series data and employs multi-year Landsat images including partially cloud-contaminated images in the cloud-removing process. ARRC also addresses the cases in which autocorrelation of Landsat time series might be adversely affected by abrupt land cover changes over multiple years. We compared ARRC with the widely-used MNSPI (modified neighborhood similar pixel interpolator) method at four challenging sites, including an urban area in Beijing and three croplands, in the North China Plain, northeastern Vietnam, and Iowa, USA. Results from the cloud-simulated images showed that ARRC performed better than MNSPI and achieved lower RMSE values (e.g., 0.02129 vs. 0.03005, 0.03293 vs. 0.04725, 0.02740 vs. 0.03556, and 0.03303 vs. 0.03973 in the near-infrared band at the four testing sites, respectively). Moreover, the experiments demonstrated improved performance when clear pixels in partially cloud-contaminated images were used by ARRC. Furthermore, cloud-free images reconstructed by ARRC were visually better than those reconstructed by MNSPI when both approaches were applied to actual cloud-contaminated Landsat images.', '[Cao, Ruyin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hi Tech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.

Despite being a critical issue for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and food security, the detection of the onset, duration, and magnitude of land degradation remains challenging, as is early identification of short-term vegetation loss preceding land degradation. Here, we present a new approach for monitoring both short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation in grasslands using satellite data. Our approach integrates Spectral Mixture Analysis and temporal segmentation, and analyzes dense time-series of satellite observations in three steps. First, we unmix all available satellite observations and aggregate them into monthly composites. Second, we calculate the annual Cumulative Endmember Fractions and examine their piecewise trends among years to determine the onset, duration, and magnitude of short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation. Third, we attribute a decrease in the green vegetation fraction with a concomitant increase in either open soil, or non-photosynthetic vegetation. We tested our method mapping short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation in grasslands in the Caucasus Ecoregion using the 2001-2018 time series of MODIS 8-day reflectance data. We found strong patterns of short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation, mostly in the eastern part of the Caucasus Ecoregion in areas of desert and semi-desert natural vegetation. Short-term vegetation loss episodes (3-9 years) were more common and had greater magnitude than decadal degradation (>= 10 years), especially in steppe regions. On average, 9.3% of grassland area was subjected annually to either decadal, or short-term vegetation loss. Desiccation, i.e., the shift from green vegetation to dry vegetation, was the most prevalent type of change pathway, with green vegetation loss to open soil coming second. Decadal degradation and short-term vegetation loss rates were the highest in dry areas where the potential natural vegetation is sub-shrub deserts, or halophytic, alluvial, and wet lowland forests. Our findings support known general degradation patterns in the Caucasus Ecoregion, but provide better understanding of ongoing processes, by detecting exact location, timing, and magnitude of changes. More broadly, our method advances the monitoring of grasslands by detecting both decadal degradation and shortterm vegetation loss. This flexibility supports adaptive degradation monitoring, aids sustainable land management, and provides new information for carbon stock analyses and biodiversity conservation.', '[Lewinska, Katarzyna Ewa; Buchner, Johanna; Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, SILVIS Lab, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

Based on two widely used global PWV products, i.e., satellite-based MODIS and reanalysis-based ERA5 products, here we propose a data fusion approach to generate PWV maps of spatiotemporal continuity and high resolution (0.01 degrees, daily) for the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR, referred to as the Yarlung Zangbo River in China) basin in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during the monsoon period (May - September) from 2007 to 2013. Results show that the fused PWV estimates have good agreement with PWV estimates from nine GPS stations (i.e., correlation coefficient: 0.87-0.97, overall bias: -0.4-1.8 mm, and root-mean-square error: 1.1-2.0 mm), greatly improving the accuracy of the MODIS PWV product. The fused PWV maps of high spatial resolution provide detailed and reasonable spatial variations which are generally consistent with those from the MODIS estimates under confident clear conditions and ERA5. Mean monthly PWV estimates across the UBR basin vary from similar to 6 to similar to 12 mm during the study period, and for each month high PWV values are found along the UBR valley and at the basin outlet. The developed data fusion approach maximizes the potential of satellite and reanalysis-based PWV products for retrieving PWV and has the potential to be applied to other high-mountain regions. The generated PWV estimates for the UBR basin are valuable in understanding the water and energy cycles and in retrieving atmospheric and surface variables for the southern TP including the Himalaya.', '[Li, Xueying; Long, Di] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.', 'Tsinghua UniversityRP Long, D (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.', 'dlong@tsinghua.edu.cnRI Long, Di/N-8049-2013', 'Long, Di/0000-0001-9033-5039', 'National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0405802];   National Natural Science Foundation of China [51722903, 91547210]', 'This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development   Program of China (grant No.2017YFC0405802) and the National Natural   Science Foundation of China (grant No.51722903 and 91547210).

The RFR model had higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.13 m, MAPE = 33.43%, and MNB = 14.55%) and was more suitable for eutrophic and turbid inland lakes across Eastern China than the other available Z(sd) algorithms. The average OLCI-derived Z(sd) of the lakes in Eastern China was 0.44 +/- 0.13 m, suggesting that these lakes are extremely turbid. The average Zsd of lakes in the Eastern Plain Lake (EPL) zone (0.45 +/- 0.12 m) was higher than that of the lakes in the Northeastern Plain and Mountain Lake (NPML) zone (0.40 +/- 0.17 m). The majority of lakes showed higher Z(sd) values in summer (rainy season) than in fall and winter (dry season). A simple SDG 6.3.2 evaluation scheme was developed based on the Zsd product, and only 54.65% of the lakes (N = 47) reached the \"good\" level during the monitoring period as a result of the eutrophication of the lakes in Eastern China.

To understand the factors that control it, accurate methods for estimating prefire vegetation structure and composition as well as fire propagation conditions are required. Here we analyzed the spatial variability of fire severity in a mixed-severity fire (3217 ha) that occurred in southeast Spain (Yeste, Albacete) from 27th July to 1th August 2017, burning mostly a pine woodland, including part of an earlier fire in 1994. Fire severity was estimated using three satellite-based indices derived from the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images from the dates before and immediately after fire. The field-based Composite Burn Index (CBI) was used for validation. Prefire vegetation conditions and fuel models were derived from LiDAR metrics and other vegetation data. Fire propagation conditions were estimated based on a fire progression map provided by the Forestry Services of Castilla-La Mancha. In addition, hourly fire weather and aligned (i.e., in the sense of the propagating fire-front) slope and wind speed were calculated for each burning period. Regression models using different spectral fire severity indices and their driving factors were obtained applying Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs). Fire severity was highly predicted by both burning conditions and prefire vegetation (mean adjusted R-2 [Adj.R-2]: 86% +/- 0.04 and 68% +/- 0.05 for training and validation sets, respectively). Alone, burning conditions explained more variance than LiDAR metrics and vegetation separately. The single variables that contributed most to the models were the rate of spread of the fire-front, biomass proxies (i.e., Leaf Area Index [LAI] and fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation [fPAR]) and understory vegetation (i.e., density of LiDAR points 1-2 m). Higher fire severity occurred in areas burning uphill, with a high rate of spread driven by high velocity winds and under high maximum temperature. Fire severity was high in wooded stands that were heterogeneous in height, composed by scattered and small Pinus halepensis trees, with high and homogeneous understory cover. In contrast, lower fire severity occurred in mature stands dominated by tall Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra trees. There were strong interactions between vegetation, weather, fire-aligned topography and rate of spread. Because vegetation variables were important drivers of fire severity, even under extreme fire weather conditions, fuel management treatments to limit fire severity and, potentially, fire size should be implemented.', '[Viedma, O.; Moreno, J.

The heterogeneity of built-up areas and infrastructures as well as the importance of not only mapping, but also characterizing anthropogenic structures suggests using a sub-pixel mapping approach for analysing related LC from space. We implement a regression-based unmixing approach for mapping built-up surfaces and infrastructure, woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation for all of Germany and Austria at 10 m resolution to demonstrate the potential of sub-pixel mapping. We map LC fractions for one point in time, using all available Sentinel-2 data from 2017 and 2018 (< 70% cloud cover). We combine the concept of synthetically mixed training data with statistical aggregations from spectral-temporal metrics (STM) derived from Sentinel-2 reflectance time series. We specifically examine how STM can be used for creating synthetically mixed training data. STM are known to facilitate large area mapping by being largely independent of image acquisition dates and inherently incorporate phenological information. Vegetation is an important part of settlements and time series information supports its mapping. Synthetically mixed training data facilitates a streamlined training by using pure reference spectra to generate artificial mixtures as input to regression modelling of LC fractions in mixed pixels. We here show how combining both offers great potential for wall-to-wall LC fraction mapping. We further investigate the positive effect of STM on map results by comparing the performance of different subsets of STM combinations. Our results indicate that many STM combinations containing spectral variability and vegetation indices provide suitable input to creating synthetic training data for regression-based fraction mapping. Results for built-up surfaces and infrastructure (MAE 0.13/RMSE 0.18 at 20 m resolution), woody vegetation (0.18, 0.22) and non-woody vegetation (0.14, 0.19) are highly consistent across Germany and Austria. Only a few surface types were not accurately predicted in our nation-wide mapping. Further research is required to optimize mapping of temporally invariant bare soil and rock surfaces that show spectral similarity to built-up surfaces and infrastructure. The proposed methodology combines benefits of both regression-based modelling with synthetically mixed training data and STM, and thus facilitates mapping of LC fractions on a national scale and at high resolution.

The development of repeatable methods to produce accurate and consistent fire severity maps from satellite imagery is necessary to document fire regimes, to set priorities for post-fire management responses, and for research applications. Machine learning techniques, such as random forest, have shown great promise for mapping of wildfire severity in woodland and forest ecosystems using satellite imagery. However, an assessment of the properties of training data required for automated mapping with random forest is currently lacking. This study examined how training data properties affect fire severity classification across forest, woodland and shrubland communities of southern Australia. The aims of this study were: (i) to examine how sample size (i.e. number of training points and fire events) and sample imbalance affect classification accuracy; (ii) to determine whether models were transferrable across geographic regions; and (iii) to assess the need for classifiers for prescribed burns and wildfires. We sampled 33 wildfires and 57 prescribed burns occurring across southern Australia between 2006 and 2019, to derive an extensive dataset (n = 25, 350 points) suitable for model training and validation. Five fire severity classes were mapped across the forest, woodland and shrubland communities. Using independent spatial cross validation of wildfires, we found that a minimum of 300 sample points per severity class, sampled across at least ten independent fires, was sufficient to reach the upper threshold of classification accuracy for the five severity classes. Training datasets derived across broad environmental space or close (<= 100 km) to the target fire (i.e. fire to be mapped) produced better predictions than those derived regionally and far (> 100 km) from the target fire. Models trained on data derived from both wildfires and prescribed burns had similar overall accuracy as those trained only on data from the fire type being predicted. However, there were significant differences in accuracy between the models trained with wildfires, prescribed burns and combined datasets within some severity classes. The random forest classifier had an overall accuracy of similar to 88% for wildfires and similar to 68% for prescribed burns across the study fires. The discrepancy in accuracy between wildfires and burns was likely due to the poorer classification performance for low fire severity classes, the dominant severity classes in prescribed burns. Overall classification accuracy was relatively consistent across forest, woodland and shrubland communities within the study fires, indicating that the method is robust across the temperate forest biome of southern Australia. Our results demonstrate that consideration of training data properties, specifically the number of points and fires sampled, sample balance and the geographic source of sample data, will be important considerations for the automated mapping of fire severity using random forest classification and Landsat imagery.', '[Collins, Luke] La Trobe Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Evolut, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.

We analyzed IAV of northern hemisphere ecosystems using several remote sensing datasets, including longstanding observations of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and more novel metrics for productivity including solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv). Although previous studies have suggested SIF better tracks variations in ecosystem productivity at seasonal timescales, we found that satellite datasets (including SIF) and eddy covariance flux tower observations were subject to significant uncertainty when assessing IAV at fine spatial scales. Even when observations were aggregated regionally, IAV in productivity estimated by the various satellite products were not always well correlated. In response to these inconsistencies, we applied a statistical method on regionally aggregated productivity data in four selected North American ecoregions and identified two dominant modes of IAV-seasonal redistribution and amplification-that were consistent across satellite datasets. The seasonal redistribution mode, which played a stronger role at lower latitudes, associated high (low) spring productivity with warm (cold) spring and summer temperatures, but also with lower (higher) productivity and water availability in summer and fall, indicating that enhanced growth in spring may contribute to an earlier depletion of water resources. The amplification mode associated an increase (decrease) in productivity across the growing season with above-average (below-average) summer moisture conditions. Even though our statistical analysis at large spatial scales revealed meaningful links between terrestrial productivity and climate drivers, our analysis does suggest that IAV and long-term trends in presently available novel and more established satellite observations must be interpreted cautiously, with careful attention to the spatial scales at which a robust signal emerges.', '[Butterfield, Zachary; Keppel-Aleks, Gretchen] Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.

Although multi-temporal remote sensing offers unique capability to monitor S. alterniflora over large areas and long time periods, three major hurdle exist: (1) in the coastal zone where S. alterniflora occupies, frequent cloud coverage reduces the number of available images that can be used; (2) prominent spectral variations exist within the S. alterniflora due to phonological variations; (3) poor spectral separability between S. alterniflora and its co-dominant native species is often presented in the territories where S. alterniflora intruded in. To articulate these questions, we proposed a new pixel-based phenological feature composite method (PpfCM) based on Google Earth Engine. The Ppf-CM method was brainstormed to battle the aforementioned three hurdles as the basic unit for extracting phonological feature is individual pixel in lieu of an entire image scene. With the Ppf-CM-derived phenological feature as inputs, we took a step further to investigate the performance of the latest deep learning method as opposed to that of the conventional support vector machine (SVM); Lastly, we strive to understand how S. alterniflora has changed its spatial distribution in the Beibu Gulf of China from 1995 to 2017. As a result, we found (1) the developed Ppf-CM method can mitigate the phonological variation and augment the spectral separability between S. alterniflora and the background species regardless of the significant cloud coverage in the study area; (2) deep learning, compared to SVM, presented better potentials for incorporating the new phenological features generated from the Ppf-CM method; and (3) for the first time, we discovered a S. alterniflora invasion outbreak occurred during 1996-2001.', '[Tian, Jinyan; Li, Xiaojuan; Gong, Huili; Shi, Chen; Song, Xiaonan; Liu, Xiaomeng] Capital Normal Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Imaging Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.

The decision by the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program to open data from its Sentinel-1 SAR satellites to the public marks the first time global, operational SAR data have been made freely available. Combined with the emergence of cloud computing platforms like the Google Earth Engine (GEE), this development presents a tremendous opportunity to the disaster response community, for whom rapid access to analysis-ready data is needed to inform effective flood disaster response interventions and management plans. Here, we present an algorithm that exploits all available Sentinel-1 SAR images in combination with historical Landsat and other auxiliary data sources hosted on the GEE to rapidly map surface inundation during flood events. Our algorithm relies on multi-temporal SAR statistics to identify unexpected floods in near real-time. Additionally, historical Landsat-based surface water class probabilities are used to distinguish unexpected floods from permanent or seasonally occurring surface water. We assessed our algorithm over three recent flood events using coincident very high- spatial resolution imagery and operational flood maps. Using very high resolution optical imagery, we estimated an area-normalized accuracy of 89.8 +/- 2.8% (95% c.i.) over Houston, Texas following Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017, representing an improvement of between 1.6% and 9.8% over flood maps derived from a simple backscatter threshold. Additionally, comparison of our results with SAR-derived Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) maps following devastating floods in Thessaly, Greece and Eastern Madagascar in January and March 2018, respectively, yielded overall agreement rates of 98.5% in both cases. Importantly, our algorithm was able to ingest hundreds of SAR and optical images served on the GEE to produce flood maps over affected areas within minutes, circumventing the need for time-consuming data download and pre-processing steps. The flexibility of our algorithm will allow for the rapid processing of future open-access SAR data, including data from future Sentinel-1 missions.', '[DeVries, Ben] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Guelph, ON, Canada.

Unlike widely used algorithms, the new approach optimally fuses multiple sources of surface temperatures into the inversion process and confines the retrievals to their feasible climatological range rather than the mean and paves the way to account for the slow changes of VOD through a Sobolev-norm regularization. Through controlled numerical experiments that assume a random error in the surface temperatures, it is shown that the algorithm can decrease the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 78% and 81% when compared with the unconstrained version and 54% and 7% when a single source of surface temperature is used in retrievals of SM and VOD, respectively. The use of the Sobolev-norm regularization decreases the RMSE by more than 25% at the expense of a negligible bias. Implementation of the algorithm, using data from the NASA\'s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite in 2016, demonstrates that the monthly RMSE of SM retrievals improves by more than 6% when compared with the SMAP enhanced products considering the ground measurements from the International SM Network (ISMN) as a reference while the monthly RMSE of VOD decreases by more than 62% when compared with the VOD climatology used in the SMAP SCA products. Analysis of the results demonstrates that, without increasing the native resolution of radiometric observations, the information content of the a priori constraints cannot only improve resolutions of the retrievals but also make them robust to the background water contamination in the vicinity of coastal zones and over lowland floodplains. For example, over Florida peninsula, the annual SM RMSE and bias are reduced by more than 65%.', '[Gao, Lun; Sadeghi, Morteza; Ebtehaj, Ardeshir] Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil Environm & Geoengn, St Anthony Falls Lab, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA.', 'University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin CitiesRP Gao, L (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil Environm & Geoengn, St Anthony Falls Lab, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA.', 'gaoxx996@umn.edu', NULL, 'NASA\'s Science Utilization of the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SUSMAP)   Satellite [NNX16AM12G]; Terrestrial Hydrology Program (THP)   [80NSSC18K1528]; NASA [900378, NNX16AM12G] Funding Source: Federal   RePORTER', 'This research is conducted under the support by the NASA\'s Science   Utilization of the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SUSMAP) Satellite   (NNX16AM12G) and the Terrestrial Hydrology Program (THP, 80NSSC18K1528)   through Dr. J.

In Australia, mangroves are protected by law and hence the natural drivers predominate. To determine annual national level changes in mangroves between 1987 and 2016, their extent (by canopy cover type) and dynamics were quantified using dense time-series (nominally every 16 days cloud permitting) of 25 m spatial resolution Landsat sensor data available within Digital Earth Australia (DEA). The potential area that mangroves occupied over this period was established as the union of mangrove maps generated for 1996, 2007-2010 and 2015/16 through the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW). Within this area, the green vegetation fractional cover (GVpc) was retrieved from each available cloud-masked Landsat scene through linear spectral unmixing. The 10th percentile (GVpc10) was then determined for each calendar year by comparing these data in a time-series. The percentage Planimetric Canopy Cover (PCC%) for each Landsat pixel was then estimated using a relationship between GVpc10 and LiDAR-derived PCC% (<1 m resolution and based on acquisitions from all states supporting mangroves, excluding Victoria). The resulting annual maps of mangrove extent and cover for Australia are the first to be generated at a continental scale and on an annual basis. These indicated that the total area of mangrove forest (canopy cover >20%; resolvable at the Landsat resolution) varied from a minima of 10,715 +/- 36 km(2) (95% confidence interval) in 1992 to a maxima of 11,388 km(2) +/- 38 km(2) (95% CI) in 2010, declining to 11,142 +/- 57 km(2) (95% CI) in 2017. In 2010 (maximum extent), the forests were classified as closed canopy (38.8%), open canopy (49.0%) and woodland mangrove (12.2%). The majority of change occurred along the northern Australian coastline and was concentrated in the major gulfs and sounds. The 30 national maps of annual mangrove extent represent a reference dataset, which is publicly available through the Terrestrial Environment Research Network (TERN) landscapes portal. Future efforts are focusing on the routine production of annual mangrove maps beyond 2019 as part of Australia\'s efforts to monitor the coastal environment.', '[Lymburner, Leo; Alam, Imam; Phillips, Claire] Geosci Australia, Natl Earth & Marine Observat Grp, Symonston, ACT, Australia.

The four-stream solution is first applied to describe the interaction between the soil background and the vegetation layers. This leads to the calibration of four terms for a given canopy structure, observation configuration and leaf properties. This number can be reduced to two terms by using a linear approximation which shows a slight degradation when the multiple scattering contribution is significant. The dependency of each of the two or four terms on wavelength and leaf properties is described using the leaf total absorption coefficient. Our approach requires only 12 (linear approximation) to 24 (four-stream solution) simulations of a reference model to describe the full canopy reflectance dependency on wavelength, leaf and soil properties. The approach was evaluated against reference canopy reflectance simulations using the ray tracing LuxCoreRender model. LuxCoreRender was first compared against reference radiative transfer models. The reference dataset corresponds to a range of detailed 3D maize canopies showing variation of leaf and background properties and one heterogeneous scene including vegetation elements of different shapes that is classically used for model inter-comparison exercises under different view and sun directions in a set of wavebands. Results demonstrate that our approach provides an accurate description of the dependency of canopy reflectance on wavelength, leaf and soil properties with RMSE = 0.0017 for the four-stream solution and RMSE = 0.0022 for the linear approximation. The proposed approach appears therefore computationally effective and well suited to generate a large number of canopy reflectance simulations with detailed 3D radiative transfer models that can be used to retrieve vegetation characteristics from remote sensing observations.', '[Jiang, Jingyi; Weiss, Marie; Liu, Shouyang; Baret, Frederic] UAPV, INRA, EMMAH, UMR 1114, F-84914 Avignon, France.

Many such global inventories use satellite measurements of active fires and/or burned area from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, differences across inventories in the interpretation of satellite imagery, the emissions factors assumed for different components of smoke, and the adjustments made for small and obscured fires can result in large regional differences in fire emissions estimates across inventories. Using Google Earth Engine, we leverage 15 years (2003-2017) of MODIS observations and 6 years (2012-2017) of observations from the higher spatial resolution Visible Imaging Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor to develop metrics to quantify five major sources of spatial bias or uncertainty in the inventories: (1) primary reliance on active fires versus burned area, (2) cloud/haze burden on the ability of satellites to \"see\" fires, (3) fragmentation of burned area, (4) roughness in topography, and (5) small fires, which are challenging to detect. Based on all these uncertainties, we devise comprehensive \"relative fire confidence scores,\" mapped globally at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution over 2003-2017.   We then focus on fire activity in Indonesia as a case study to analyze how the choice of a fire emissions inventory affects model estimates of smoke-induced health impacts across Equatorial Asia. We use the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and apply emissions of particulate organic carbon and black carbon (OC + BC smoke) from five global inventories: Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv4s), Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINNv1.5), Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1.2), Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFEDv2.5r1), and Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEERv1.0-G1.2). We find that modeled monthly smoke PM2.5 in Singapore from 2003 to 2016 correlates with observed smoke PM2.5, with r ranging from 0.64-0.84 depending on the inventory. However, during the burning season (July to October) of high fire intensity years (e.g., 2006 and 2015), the magnitude of mean Jul-Oct modeled smoke PM2.5 can differ across inventories by > 20 mu g m(-3) (> 500%). Using the relative fire confidence metrics, we deduce that uncertainties in this region arise primarily from the small, fragmented fire landscape and very poor satellite observing conditions due to clouds and thick haze at this time of year. Indeed, we find that modeled smoke PM2.5 using GFASv1.2, which adjusts for fires obscured by clouds and thick haze and accounts for peatland emissions, is most consistent with observations in Singapore, as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia. Finally, we develop an online app called FIRECAM for end-users of global fire emissions inventories. The app diagnoses differences in emissions among the five inventories and gauges the relative uncertainty associated with satellite-observed fires on a regional basis.', '[Liu, Tianjia] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

A synchronized examination of lake and glacier mass variations there has not previously been conducted, which has limited the understanding of the lake water balance and the hydrologic cycle in the region. In this study, we comprehensively examine lake area and volume, and glacier mass changes using multi-sensor satellite data. We find that lake expansion in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau was more robust from 1976 to 2018 when compared to other regions of the plateau, especially for the glacier-fed and endorheic lakes. Lake volume changes show that most of the lakes had an increase in water volume, particularly in 20002018 with a total water storage gain of similar to 28.6 Gt. By using high-resolution KH-9 and TanDEM-X data, we observe that the glacier surface elevation of the western Kunlun Mountains had a slight thinning rate of -0.07 +/- 0.16 m/yr in 1973-2000, but a positive rate of 0.002 +/- 0.003 m/yr in 2000-2018. The heterogeneous pattern of glacier elevation changes between the north (N) and south (S) slopes are revealed, i.e. -0.02 +/- 0.01 m/yr (N) against -0.12 +/- 0.03 m/yr (S) in 1973-2000 and - 0.05 +/- 0.02 m/yr (N) against 0.06 +/- 0.02 m/yr (S) in 2000-2018. Overall, the glaciers trend to a stable state (similar to 0.05 m/yr) in both the south slope of the western Kunlun Mountains and Aru Co regions between 2000 and 2018. Similar patterns are also found for basin-wide examinations of lake storage changes (mass gains) and glacier mass budgets (positive or close to stable). The seasonal snow cover area changes, derived from cloud-free MODIS snow cover products, present a variable and insignificant trend between 2003 and 2017. Snow depth derived from passive microwave remote-sensing data, exhibits a decreasing trend between 1979 and 2015, but the water equivalent could contribute only an insignificant amount to the observed lake changes.

Understanding how temperature drives species richness patterns is particularly important in the context of global change and for effective conservation planning. Landsat 8\'s Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) allows direct mapping of temperature at moderate spatial resolutions (100 m, downscaled by the USGS to 30 m), overcoming limitations inherent in coarse interpolated weather station data that poorly capture fine-scale temperature patterns over broad areas. TIRS data thus offer the unique opportunity to understand how the thermal environment influences species richness patterns. Our aim was to develop and assess the ability of TIRS-based temperature metrics to predict patterns of winter bird richness across the conterminous United States during winter, a period of marked temperature stress for birds. We used TIRS data from 2013-2018 to derive metrics of relative temperature and intra-seasonal thermal heterogeneity. To quantify winter bird richness across the conterminous US, we tabulated the richness only for resident bird species, i.e., those species that do not move between the winter and breeding seasons, from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, the most extensive survey of birds in the US. We expected that relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity would have strong positive associations with winter bird richness because colder temperatures heighten temperature stress for birds, and thermal heterogeneity is a proxy for thermal niches and potential thermal refugia that can support more species. We further expected that both the strength of the effects and the relative importance of these variables would be greater for species with greater climate sensitivity, such as small-bodied species and climate-threatened species (i.e., those with large discrepancies between their current and future distributions following projected climate change). Consistent with our predictions, relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity strongly positively influenced winter bird richness patterns, with statistical models explaining 37.3% of the variance in resident bird richness. Thermal heterogeneity was the strongest predictor of small-bodied and climate-threatened species in our models, whereas relative temperature was the strongest predictor of large-bodied and climate-stable species. Our results demonstrate the important role that the thermal environment plays in governing winter bird richness patterns and highlight the previously underappreciated role that intra-seasonal thermal heterogeneity may have in supporting high winter bird species richness. Our findings thus illustrate the exciting potential for TIRS data to guide conservation planning in an era of global change.', '[Elsen, Paul R.; Farwell, Laura S.; Pidgeon, Anna M.; Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, SILVIS Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

In recent years, due largely to the inevitability of classification errors in remote sensing-based maps and the marked effects of these errors on subsequent area estimates, sample-based area estimates of land cover and land change have increased in importance and use. Area estimation of land cover and change by sampling is often made more efficient by a priori knowledge of the study area to be analyzed (e.g., stratification). Satellite data, obtained free of cost for virtually all of Earth\'s land surface, provide an excellent source for constructing landscape stratifications in the form of maps. Errors of omission, defined as sample units observed as land change but mapped as a stable class, may introduce considerable uncertainty in parameter estimates obtained from the sample data (e.g., area estimates of land change). The effects of omission errors are exacerbated in situations where the area of intact forest is large relative to the area of forest change, a common situation in countries that seek results-based payments for reductions in deforestation and associated carbon emissions. The presence of omission errors in such situations can preclude the acquisition of statistically valid evidence of a reduction in deforestation, and thus prevent payments. International donors and countries concerned with mitigating the effects of climate change are looking for guidance on how to reduce the effects of omission errors on area estimates of land change. This article presents the underlying reasons for the effects of omission errors on area estimates, case studies highlighting real-world examples of these effects, and proposes potential solutions. Practicable approaches to efficiently splitting large stable strata are presented that may reduce the effects of omission errors and immediately improve the quality of estimates. However, more research is needed before further recommendations can be provided on how to contain, mitigate and potentially eliminate the effects of omissions errors.', '[Olofsson, Pontus; Arevalo, Paulo] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 685 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

Among these, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have shown exceptional efficiency in automated deprivation mapping at the local scale. Yet these networks have never been used to map very small heterogeneous deprivation areas (pockets) at large scale. This study proposes and evaluates a U-Net-Compound model to map deprivation pockets in Bangalore, India. The model only relies on RGB satellite images with a resolution of 2 m as these are more commonly accessible to local urban planning departments. The experiment assumes a practical situation where only limited reference data is available for the model to learn the spatial morphology of deprivation pockets. It tests whether an updated map of deprivation pockets can be obtained with limited information. The model performance to map a large number of deprivation pockets is examined by incrementally changing the model architecture and the amount of training data. Results show that the proposed model is sensitive to the amount of spatial information contained in the training data. Once sufficient spatial information is learnt through a few samples, the city scale mapping accuracy outperforms existing models in mapping small deprivation pockets, achieving a Jaccard Index of 54%. This study demonstrated that a well-designed convolutional neural network can map the existence, extent, as well as distribution patterns of deprivation pockets at the city scale with limited training data, which is essential for upscaling research outputs to provide important information for the formulation of pro-poor policies.', '[Wang, Jiong; Kuffer, Monika; Pfeffer, Karin] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

The algorithm self-adapts to the local scattering conditions and it is robust to variations of input data availability. The algorithm applies the Reed-Xiaoli detector (RXD) to distinguish anomalous changes of the backscatter coefficient. Such changes are linked to fire events, which are derived from thermal anomalies (hotspots) acquired during the detection period by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors. Land cover maps were used to account for changing backscatter behaviour as the RXD is class dependent. A machine learning classifier (random forests) was used to detect burned areas where hotspots were not available. Burned area perimeters derived from optical images (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) were used to validate the algorithm results. The validation dataset covers 21 million hectares in 18 locations that represent the main biomes affected by fires, from boreal forests to tropical and sub-tropical forests and savannas.

However, such estimates at regional and local scales are still highly uncertain. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can characterize the structural and functional diversity of forests with high accuracy at a sub-meter resolution, and potentially improve the AGB estimations. In this study, we compared the ability of different data sources (airborne LiDAR and HSI, and their combination) and regression methods (linear model - LM, linear model with ridge regularization - LMR, Support Vector Regression - SVR, Random Forest - RF, Stochastic Gradient Boosting - SGB, and Cubist - CB) to improve AGB predictions in the Brazilian Amazon. We used georeferenced inventory data from 132 sample plots to obtain a reference field AGB and calculated 333 metrics (45 from LiDAR and 288 from HSI) that could be used as predictors for statistical AGB models. We submitted the metrics to a correlation filtering followed by a feature selection procedure (recursive feature elimination) to optimize the performance of the models and to reduce their complexity. Results showed that both LiDAR and HSI data used alone provided relatively high accurate models if adequate metrics and algorithms are chosen (RMSE = 67.6 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE% = 36%, R-2 = 0.58, for the best LiDAR model; RMSE = 68.1 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE % = 36%, R-2 = 0.58, for the best HSI model). However, HSI-only models required more metrics (5-12) than LiDAR-only models (2-5). Models combining metrics from both datasets resulted in more accurate AGB estimates, regardless of the regression method (RMSE = 57.7 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE% = 31%, R-2 = 0.70, for the best model). The most important LiDAR metrics for estimating AGB were related to the upper canopy cover and tree height percentiles, while the most important HSI metrics were associated with the near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions, particularly the leaf/canopy water and lignin-cellulose absorption bands. Finally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the remote sensing data source (LiDAR, HSI, or their combination) had a greater effect size than the regression algorithms. Thus, no single algorithm outperformed the others, although the LM method was less suitable when applied to the HSI and hybrid datasets.

In pursuit of this goal, a series of poverty reduction policies and measures have been proposed. As a vital element of poverty reduction, land use in China\'s poverty-stricken areas also undergone great changes accordingly. However, the land use change patterns in these areas are not well understood. It\'s necessary to analyze the spatial-temporal land use change patterns to provide data that support poverty alleviation programs. In this study, we proposed a framework for mapping annual land use changes in China\'s poverty-stricken areas from 2013 to 2018. The Landsat 8 surface reflectance datasets from 2013 to 2018 (available on Google Earth Engine) were utilized to detect the changes in arable land, built-up land, water, vegetation, and un-used land. The land use transition matrix was computed to describe characteristics of the transition, and a Bayesian hierarchical model was employed to investigate the spatial-temporal land use change patterns. Our results demonstrated that the arable land continuously decreased over the study period, while built-up land and vegetation gradually expanded. The primary land use transition occurred between the arable land and vegetation. The local trends of each county indicated obvious regional differences of land use change. Moreover, significant differences existed between deep poverty-stricken counties and normal poverty-stricken counties on arable land and built-up land change, indicating that more intense human construction activities in normal poverty-stricken areas. The annual land use mapping results generated for poverty-stricken areas, along with further analysis of overall temporal change and local change trends, could provide a better understanding of land use changes and regional differences in China\'s poverty-stricken areas and promote the poverty reduction and sustainable development in those areas.', '[Ge, Yong; Hu, Shan; Ren, Zhoupeng; Jia, Yuanxin; Wang, Jianghao; Liu, Mengxiao; Zhang, Die] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Previous studies of the 2008 Yutian earthquake occurred on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau, and are limited by a lack of detailed measurements of fault structures and near-fault motion due to the inaccessibility and extreme weather of the area and severe decorrelation of InSAR. In this paper, we use a very high resolution (VHR) DEM of the 2008 rupture zone extracted from the Pleiades satellite stereo imagery to measure the 3-D fault geometry and on-fault slip. The maximum vertical and horizontal coseismic displacement is 3.6 m and 2.8 m respectively. Despite the overall normal faulting, near-fault reverse vertical motion was observed, ranging from 0.5 m to 1.9 m, caused by the transformation of strike-slip motion into localised shortening due to local fault geometric variations. Measurements of the near-surface dip for the three fault segments (55 degrees, 62 degrees, and 58 degrees) show good consistency, different from previous studies (43 degrees, 60 degrees, and 52 degrees). Joint inversion of InSAR and the near-fault measurements of surface slip also show that the fault geometry does not change much along strike. The local ratio of the cumulative to the coseismic vertical offset recorded on an old alluvial fan and an ice tongue ranges from 1.86 to 2.79, suggesting at least 1-2 historical events occurred here before the 2008 earthquake.', '[Song, Xiaogang; Han, Nana; Shan, Xinjian; Zhang, Yingfeng; Yin, Hao; Zhang, Guohong] China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geol, State Key Lab Earthquake Dynam, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.

Conventional methods of pixel-based classification label each pixel independently by considering only a pixel\'s spectral properties. While these purely spectral-based techniques may be applicable to many medium and coarse-scale remote sensing analyses, they may become less appropriate when applied to high spatial resolution imagery in which the pixels are smaller than the objects to be classified. At this scale, there is often higher intra-class spectral heterogeneity than interclass spectral heterogeneity, leading to difficulties in using purely spectral-based classifications. A solution to these issues is to use not only a pixel\'s spectral characteristics but also its spatial characteristics. In this study, we develop a generalizable \"spatialized\" classification approach for high spatial resolution image classification. We apply the proposed approach to map vegetation growth forms such as trees, shrubs, and herbs in a forested ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

In this paper, we investigate two common conclusions generally made for LMA and EWT estimation based on leaf optical properties in the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) domains: (1) physically-based approaches estimate EWT accurately and LMA poorly, while (2) statistically-based and machine learning (ML) methods provide accurate estimates of both LMA and EWT.   Using six experimental datasets including broadleaf species samples of >150 species collected over tropical, temperate and boreal ecosystems, we compared the performances of a physically-based method (PROSPECT model inversion) and a ML algorithm (support vector machine regression, SVM) to infer EWT and LMA based on leaf reflectance and transmittance. We assessed several merit functions to invert PROSPECT based on iterative optimization and investigated the spectral domain to be used for optimal estimation of LMA and EWT. We also tested several strategies to select the training samples used by the SVM, in order to investigate the generalization ability of the derived regression models.   We evidenced that using spectral information from 1700 to 2400 nm leads to strong improvement in the estimation of EWT and LMA when performing a PROSPECT inversion, decreasing the LMA and EWT estimation errors by 55% and 33%, respectively.   The comparison of various sampling strategies for the training set used with SVM suggests that regression models show limited generalization ability, particularly when the regression model is applied on data fully independent from the training set. Finally, our results demonstrate that, when using an appropriate spectral domain, the PROSPECT inversion outperforms SVM trained with experimental data for the estimation of EWT and LMA. Thus we recommend that estimation of LMA and EWT based on leaf optical properties should be physically-based using inversion of reflectance and transmittance measurements on the 1700 to 2400 nm spectral range.', '[Feret, J-B.; de Boissieu, F.] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CIRAD, TETIS,Irstea,AgroParisTech, Montpellier, France.

Most countries do not have a precise measurement of water consumption for irrigation. In this study, an innovative approach is proposed that allows for estimation of irrigation water use at the catchment scale based on satellite soil moisture data. To this end, the SM2RAIN algorithm, which had been originally developed for estimation of rainfall from the soil moisture observations, is adopted. The satellite soil moisture observations obtained from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) along with different rainfall and evapotranspiration (ET) products in the period 2012-2015 are used as the input to the model. The methodology is tested in the agricultural plains of southern Urmia Lake, which is one of the main agricultural plains in Iran for which actual irrigation data is available.   The results reveal that the proposed approach can capture the overall irrigation pattern, although; it is systematically overestimating irrigation volume compared to observed irrigation data. Thus the bias is calculated over largely non-irrigated pixels and used to modify the model estimates. The bias-corrected results show good agreement with the in situ irrigation data. In particular, the average model performance in the irrigated pixels in terms of R and RMSE (mm/month) are (0.86 and 12.895) respectively. Accuracy varied depending on the inputs, with improvement in order of 11% and 42% in R and RMSE depending on the inputs chosen. The method is also applied to less irrigated areas that result in obtaining significantly lower irrigation rates.   The low spatial resolution of soil moisture products (i.e. similar to 50 km) makes it difficult to capture the irrigation water of small irrigated croplands. Unreliable rainfall and ET data can also lead to the over/underestimation of irrigation. In spite of the above limitations (particularly lack of reliable ET dataset), the proposed model can still capture the irrigation pattern, given that strong soil moisture signal from irrigation is detected by the satellite.', '[Jalilvand, Ehsan; Tajrishy, Masoud; Hashemi, Sedigheh Alsadat Ghazi Zadeh] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tehran, Iran.

The expansion of impervious surface is often spontaneous and conscious, particularly in fast developing regions. Thus, monitoring impervious surface dynamics with high temporal frequency in a both accurate and efficient manner is highly needed. Here, we propose an approach to capture continuous impervious surface dynamics using spatial-temporal rules and dense time series stacks of Landsat data. First, a stable area mask based on image classification in the start and the end years is generated to remove pixels that are persistent or spatially irrelevant. The Continuous Change Detection (CCD) algorithm is then employed to determine the change points when non-impervious cover converts to impervious surface based on the property of temporal irreversibility. Finally, the CCD time series models are calibrated for pixels with no change or multiple changes. We apply and assess the proposed approach in Nanchang (China), which has been experiencing rapid impervious surface expansion during the past decade. According to the validation results, overall accuracies of image classification in the start and the end years are 97.2% and 96.7%, respectively. Our approach generates convincing results for impervious surface change detection, with overall accuracy of 85.5% at the annual scale, which is higher than three commonly used approaches in previous studies. At the continuous scale, the mean biases of the detected time of imperviousness emergence are +0.17 (backward) and -3.42 (forward) Landsat revisit periods (16 days) for pixels with one single change and multiple changes, respectively. The derived impervious surface extent maps exhibit comparable performances with five widely used products. The present approach offers a new perspective for providing timely and accurate impervious surface dynamics with dense temporal frequency and high classification accuracy.', '[Liu, Chong; Qi, Shuhua] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Poyang Lake Wetland & Watershed Res, Nanchang 332000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.

The experiment featured airborne Passive Active L-band System (PALS) flights over each domain with intensive ground measurements and dense networks of SM monitoring stations. With two intensive observation periods separated in time (May 28 June 20 and July 14 August 16), the flights captured both early-season/low vegetation and later-season/high-vegetation conditions. The comparison of the PALS brightness temperature (TB) measurements to the SMAP TB observed over the sites resulted in root mean square difference (RMSD) of 2.8 K and 4.0 K for vertical and horizontal polarizations, respectively. The subsequent SM analysis resealed the PALS TB with the SMAP TB to allow equitable comparisons between the SM retrievals from the two instruments. The PALS SM retrieval algorithm used the SM sampled by the ground teams during the overpass days for tuning, and was parameterized by a high-resolution vegetation water content product calibrated using vegetation samples collected during the experiment. The tuning process was not able to find a satisfactory result with a temporally constant set of parameters in the single channel algorithm for the two intensive observation periods of the experiment. This result indicated that the rapid change in the vegetation structure during the growth stages and likely variation in the surface roughness conditions were not compatible with rigid parameterization over the entire period. However, using seasonally variable parameters we found that it was possible to retrieve soil moisture with satisfactory accuracy. Comparative analysis with the SMAP SM product included aggregation of the PALS SM to the SMAP pixel-scale. The RMSD between the PALS SM and the aggregated manual field samples was < 0.04 m(3)/m(3) with Pearson correlation > 0.85 for both sites. The comparison between different in situ sources indicated that the soil moisture network measurements were not the source of the large biases observed for SMAP over the sites reported in earlier studies. Therefore, the results suggested the rapidly growing vegetation and the early-season surface condition changes not captured by the SMAP algorithm caused the SMAP retrieval errors. In addition, the significant deviations of the vegetation water content used by the SMAP product from the calibrated vegetation water content obtained during the experiment compounds the problem.', '[Colliander, Andreas; Misra, Sidharth; Williamson, Ross; Ramos, Isaac; Latham, Barron; Yueh, Simon] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.

Existing global datasets of human settlement were mostly generated at medium and coarse spatial resolutions, including BUA and other impervious surfaces. With multiple high-resolution satellite constellations now available (e.g., ZiYuan-3 (ZY3), SPOT-5/6/7, Cartosat-1/2, and WorldView-2/3), identifying the global BUA explicitly from the complex landscapes becomes possible. In this study, a novel method was proposed for automated extraction of BUA at the global scale, by fusing a series of building features. Specifically, two planar features, the Morphological Building Index (MBI) and Harris corner detector, were employed to characterize the structure and corner attributes of buildings. Moreover, two multiangular built-up indices (MABIs), i.e., Ratio Multi-angular Built-up Index (RMABI) and Normalized Difference Multi-angular Built-up Index (NDMABI), were proposed to represent the vertical properties of buildings based on multi-view images, which can further complement the planar features. 45 global cities were selected to validate the performance of the proposed method with images acquired by the ZY3 satellite constellation. The results show that the fusion of MBI and Harris corner can achieve satisfactory accuracy, i.e., 91.12%, 88.85%, 82.82% and 0.85, for the average overall accuracy (OA), user\'s accuracy (UA), producer\'s accuracy (PA), and F1-score, respectively, for all the test cities. After fusing the MABIs with the planar features, the average OA, UA, PA and F values of the final results were 92.00%, 86.20%, 89.14% and 0.87 for the RMABI, and 91.83%, 85.51%, 89.62% and 0.87 for the NDMABI, respectively. In particular, addition of the MABIs can further reduce the omission errors where medium/high rise buildings with low local contrast exist.

We investigate in this study the sampling depth (delta(SM)) of the L-band microwave emission under frozen and thawed soil conditions on the Tibetan Plateau. Two years of diurnal brightness temperature (T-B(p)) measurements at a time interval of 30 min are collected by the ELBARA-III radiometer deployed at a Tibetan meadow site. Vertical profiles of soil temperature and volumetric liquid water content (theta(liq)) are measured simultaneously at soil depths up to 1 m below the surface. The impact of the theta(liq) measured at different depths on the microwave emission simulations is assessed using the tau-omega emission model, whereby the permittivity of frozen and thawed soil is estimated by the four-phase dielectric mixing model. It is found that: 1) the sampling depth for the effective temperature depends on the magnitude of theta(liq), and is estimated to be, on average, about 50 and 15 cm for the cold dry and wet warm period, respectively, because of the seasonality in theta(liq); 2) the delta(SM) is determined at 2.5 cm for both frozen and thawed soil conditions during both cold and warm periods, which is shallower than the commonly used theta(liq) measurement depth (i.e. 5 cm) adopted for the in-situ monitoring networks across the globe; 3) the T-B(p) simulations performed with the theta(liq) measurements taken at the estimated delta(SM) of 2.5 cm result in lower unbiased root mean squared errors, about 14% (3.16 K) and 22% (3.36 K) for the horizontal and vertical polarizations respectively, in comparison to the simulations with the theta(liq) measurements taken from 5 cm soil depth; and 4) the theta(liq) retrieved with the single channel algorithm from the ELBARA-III measured vertically polarized T-B(p) are in better agreement with the theta(liq) measured at 2.5 cm than the one measured at 5 cm.

The method assumes that only soil moisture varies in the period of interest, while all other parameters such as vegetation water content and soil surface roughness are sufficiently time invariant. However, this assumption is not easy to satisfy in agricultural areas where cultivation practices such as ploughing and irrigation are irregularly conducted between radar acquisitions. The paper has proposed an unsupervised change detection method to serve as a pre-processing procedure for multi-temporal retrieval. Briefly, the temporal ratio of HV and the temporal difference of HV/VV and VV polarizations were selected as the optimal feature space, using a genetic algorithm based feature selection algorithm and an extensive synthetic data set. The change map is determined from a two-step procedure with the first step producing multiple over-detected change maps for the period of interest using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method. The second step merges the multiple change maps to remove the false alarms with a principle similar to the ensemble machine learning. Evaluation on a synthetic data set demonstrated that the proposed method can largely remove the error in multi-temporal soil moisture retrieval that is caused by abrupt roughness and vegetation changes. Evaluation on real radar data sets, including airborne L-band radar, RAD-ARSAT-2 at C-band and COSMO SkyMed at X-band, demonstrated an accurate identification ( > 0.9) while yielding a low false-alarm rate ( < 0.1). These results suggest that the method may be used as a pre-processing stage of global soil moisture retrieval from radar satellite missions with a high revisit frequency, such as Sentinel-1 and SAOCOM-1.', '[Zhu, Liujun; Walker, Jeffrey P.; Ye, Nan; Rudiger, Christoph] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.', 'Monash UniversityRP Zhu, LJ (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.', 'Liujun.Zhu@monash.eduRI Walker, Jeffrey P/D-2624-2009; YE, Nan/JEO-5628-2023', 'Zhu, Liujun/0000-0003-0016-3603; Ye, Nan/0000-0003-3007-8290; Walker,   Jeffrey/0000-0002-4817-2712', 'Australian Research Council Discovery Project [DP140100572]; China   Scholarship Council (CSC); Australian Research Council (ARC); Monash   University', 'The SMAPEx-5 field campaigns were supported by an Australian Research   Council Discovery Project (DP140100572).

As remote sensing imagery continues to increase in spatial and temporal resolution, it is becoming an increasingly powerful raw input from which to create crop type maps. Still, automated crop type mapping remains constrained by a lack of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models, in this study, we explore the use of random forests transferred across geographic distance and time and unsupervised methods in conjunction with aggregate crop statistics for crop type mapping in the US Midwest, where we simulated the label-poor setting by depriving the models of labels in various states and years. We validated our methodology using available 30 m spatial resolution crop type labels from the US Department of Agriculture\'s Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Using Google Earth Engine, we computed Fourier transforms (or harmonic regressions) on the time series of Landsat Surface Reflectance and derived vegetation indices, and extracted the coefficients as features for machine learning models. We found that random forests trained on regions and years similar in growing degree days (ODD) transfer to the target region with accuracies consistently exceeding 80%. Accuracies decrease as differences in GDD expand. Unsupervised Gaussian mixture models (GMM) with class labels derived using county-level crop statistics classify crops less consistently but require no field-level labels for training. GMM achieves over 85% accuracy in states with low crop diversity (Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska), but performs sometimes no better than random when high crop diversity interferes with clustering (North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan). Under the appropriate conditions, these methods offer options for field-resolution crop type mapping in regions around the world with few or no ground labels.', '[Wang, Sherrie; Azzari, George; Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.

It consists of a tethered Balloon Launched Imaging and Monitoring Platform (BLIMP) that records LSWT images and an autonomously operating catamaran (called ZiviCat) that measures in situ surface/near surface temperatures within the image area, thus permitting simultaneous ground-truthing of the BLIMP data. The BLIMP was equipped with an uncooled InfraRed (IR) camera. The ZiviCat was designed to measure along predefined trajectories on a lake. Since LSWT spatial variability in each image is expected to be low, a poor estimation of the common spatial and temporal noise of the IR camera (nonuniformity and shutter-based drift, respectively) leads to errors in the thermal maps obtained. Nonuniformity was corrected by applying a pixelwise two-point linear correction method based on laboratory experiments. A Probability Density Function (PDF) matching in regions of overlap between sequential images was used for the drift correction. A feature matching-based algorithm, combining blob and region detectors, was implemented to create composite thermal images, and a mean value of the overlapped images at each location was considered as a representative value of that pixel in the final map. The results indicate that a high overlapping field of view (similar to 95%) is essential for image fusion and noise reduction over such low-contrast scenes. The in situ temperatures measured by the ZiviCat were then used for the radiometric calibration. This resulted in the generation of ISWT maps at sub-pixel satellite scale resolution that revealed spatial LSWT variability, organized in narrow streaks hundreds of meters long and coherent patches of different size, with unprecedented detail.', '[Rahaghi, Abolfazl Irani; Lemmin, Ulrich; Barry, David Andrew] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Ecol Engn Lab ECOL, Environm Engn Inst IIE, Fac Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.

Yet, long-term lake inventories and quantitative evaluation of the factors driving observed lake changes across China remain elusive. Here, for the first time, we examined multi-decadal lake area changes in China during 1960s-2015, using historical topographic maps and > 3831 Landsat satellite images, including lakes as fine as km(2) in size. In addition, we quantified the causes of lake changes from climatic and anthropogenic factors. The total area of lakes in China has increased by 5858.06 km(2) (9%) between 1960s and 2015, and with heterogeneous spatial variations. Lake area changes in the Tibetan Plateau, Xinjiang, and Northeast Plain and Mountain regions reveal significant increases of 5676.75, 1417.15, 1134.87 km(2) (>= 15%), respectively, but the Inner-Mongolian Plateau shows an obvious decrease of 1223.76 km(2) (22%). We find that 141 new lakes have appeared predominantly in the arid western China; but 333 lakes, mainly located in the humid eastern China, have disappeared over the past five decades. We conclude that climate factors have played a dominant role in lake changes across China, coupled with noticeable anthropogenic contribution of similar to 35% in the Eastern Plain and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.

In this study, we demonstrate the capability to improve the characterization of forest inventory attributes using terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) data, a fine-scale architectural model (L-Architect), and airborne laser scanner (ALS) data. Terrestrial laser scanning provides detailed and accurate three-dimensional data and has the potential to characterize forest plots with comprehensive structural information. We use TLS data and in situ measurements as input to L-Architect to create reference plots. The use of L-Architect for modeling was validated by comparing selected attributes of the reference plots with validation plots produced using simulated TLS data, with normalized root-mean square error (NMRSE) values below 17%. Surrogate plots were then created using a library of tree models where individual trees were selected according to three attributes tree height, diameter at breast height, and crown projected area either measured from in situ plots or derived from ALS data. The accuracy of the surrogate plots was assessed by comparing several key forest attributes from the reference plots, including branching structure (e.g., number of whorls, knot surface), crown shape and size (e.g., base height, asymmetry), heterogeneity (e.g., lacunarity, fractal dimension), tree volume, and the spatial distribution of material (e.g., Weibull fit, leaf area index). Overall, the surrogate plots reproduced the attributes of the reference plots with NRMSE mean value of 17% (R-2 = 0.68) using in situ ground measurements and 24% (R-2 = 0.51) using inputs estimated with ALS. Some attributes, such as leaf area index, knot surface, and fractal dimension, were well predicted (R-2 > 0.80), whereas others, like crown asymmetry and lacunarity, had weak correspondence (R-2 < 0.16). The ability to create surrogate forest plots with L-Architect makes it possible to estimate detailed structural attributes that are difficult to measure with conventional forest mensuration techniques and that can be used for model calibration with above-canopy remote-sensing data sets.', '[Cote, Jean-Francois] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Canadian Wood Fibre Ctr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.

We present an evaluation of changes in tall shrub ( > 0.5 m) fractional cover on the North Slope of Alaska between 2000 and 2010, using a new mapping approach that uses satellite imagery from the NASA Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) sensor, ancillary topographic and geographic variables, derived Ross-Li Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) kernel (scattering function) weights, and a Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) model. After training and validating the BRT model, 10 predictor variables explained 53% of the variation in tall shrub fractional cover. The isotropic kernel weight from the BRDF model, topographic slope, nadir camera red reflectance, and latitude were the variables that contributed to the model the most as they were used more frequently to generate the regression trees. At a spatial resolution of 250 m, predicted tall shrub fractional cover on the North Slope ranged from 0.00 to 0.21 (RMSE = 0.03), with the vast majority of sites having fractional cover < 0.02. High shrub fractional cover values were predicted along floodplains, creeks, and sloped terrain. Temporal comparisons of estimated tall shrub abundance indicated that shrubs expanded during the period 2000-2010.

Tall shrubs may have expanded throughout a larger area but there is insufficient precision in the MISR-based estimates to make an indisputable determination. Nevertheless, 94% of the locations that exhibited a robust change showed a positive trend toward an increase in shrub cover.

The remotely sensed ET was validated using ground measurements from large aperture scintillometer systems, with a source area of several kilometers, over grassland, cropland and riparian shrub-forest land cover. The results showed that the remotely sensed ET produced mean absolute percent differences (MAPD) of around 20% with the ground measurements during the growing season under clear sky conditions, but the model performance deteriorated for cloudy days. However, the daily ET product gave reasonable estimates for croplands with an MAPD value of about 20% and the estimates of T/ET and E/ET in good agreement with ground measurements. The DTD model also significantly outperformed other remote sensing-based models being applied globally.

Millions of tons of debris across oceans have created a critical environmental problem. This study presents a novel method aimed to improve the identification of macroplastics through remote sensing over beaches, combining AMD hyperspectral laboratory characterization and digital supervised classification in high spatial resolution imagery. Several samples were collected from the Chiloe Island beaches, Chile. Spectral signature samples and physical properties were assessed through laboratory work. HyLogger3 (R) (CSIRO), PS-300 Apogee and ASD Field Spec hyperspectral systems were used to characterize each sample. Using those measurements, a spectral library was generated by processing, filtering and sorting the spectral data gathered, determining distinctive spectral bands for digital classification. By using this spectral library, a digital classification method was implemented over World-View 3 imagery, covering the three beaches selected as test sites. Distinct classification methods and geospatial analyses were applied to determine land cover composition, aimed for the detection of Styrofoam and the rest of anthropogenic marine debris. Four field campaigns were carried out to validate the AMD classification and mass retrievals, performed on > 300 ground based points. The AMD hyperspectral library was successfully applied for an AMD digital classification in satellite imagery. Support Vector Machine method showed the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy equivalent to 88% and over 50 tons of debris estimated on the pilot beaches. These results prove the feasibility of quantifying macro-AMD through the integration of hyperspectral laboratory measurements and remote sensing imagery, allowing to estimate anthropogenic influence on natural ecosystems and providing valuable information for further development of the methodology and sustainable AMD management.', '[Acuna-Ruz, Tomas; Uribe, Diego; Taylor, Richard; Amezquita, Lucas; Cristina Guzman, Maria; Mattar B, Cristian] Univ Chile, LAB, Santiago, Chile.

The study was carried out over the parts of Bharatpur and Mathura districts located in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (India), respectively. The three-date time series hybrid-polarized dataset was collected coincident to which a comprehensive ground truth campaign was organised. We propose that refining the total backscatter (sigma(0)(total)) values after minimising the effect of underlying/background soil cover, would result in more accurate retrieval of plant parameters since it is the vegetation backscatter, which ultimately has a direct correlation with the crop biophysical parameters. It was achieved using a semi-empirical water cloud model (WCM) based approach. The applicability of four different combinations of canopy descriptors, i.e. leaf area index (LAI), plant water content (PWC), leaf water area index (LWAI) and interaction factor (IF that takes into consideration the moisture distribution per unit volume) was tested on the RH and RV backscatter. We found that WCM based on LAI and IF as the two canopy descriptors modelled the total backscatter with a significantly high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.90 and 0.85, respectively) and RMSE of 1.18 and 1.25 dB, respectively. Subsequently, this set was used to retrieve the soil-corrected vegetation backscatter (sigma(0)(veg)) values. A comparative evaluation of the retrieval accuracy between plant parameters estimated from sigma(0)(total) (sigma(o)(T_RH), sigma(o)(T_RV)) and sigma(0)(veg) (sigma(o)(V_RH), sigma(o)(V_RV)) was performed using rigorously trained multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The findings suggest that the prediction accuracy considerably improved when the backscatter of underlying/background soil cover was eliminated. The designed networks (with sigma(0)(total) as input) retrieved plant water content and plant volume with the highest accuracy of 0.82 and 0.80, respectively while it increased dramatically to 0.87 and 0.89 when the inputs were substituted by sigma(0)(veg).

This approach does not take advantage of the Multi-View (MV) information of the individual images. In this study, we introduce a new OBIA approach utilizing multi-view information of original UAS images and compare its performance with that of traditional OBIA, which uses only the orthophoto (Ortho-OBIA). The proposed approach, called multi-view object-based image analysis (MV-OBIA), classifies multi-view object instances on UAS images corresponding to each orthophoto object and utilizes a voting procedure to assign a final label to the orthophoto object. The proposed MV-OBIA is also compared with the classification approaches based on Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) simulation. Finally, to reduce the computational burden of multi-view object-based data generation for MV-OBIA and make the proposed approach more operational in practice, this study proposes two window-based implementations of MV-OBIA that utilize a window positioned at the geometric centroid of the object instance, instead of the object instance itself, to extract features. The first window-based MV-OBIA adopts a fixed window size (denoted as FWMV-OBIA), while the second window-based MV-OBIA uses an adaptive window size (denoted as AWMV-OBIA). Our results show that the MV-OBIA substantially improves the overall accuracy compared with Ortho-OBIA, regardless of the features used for classification and types of wetland land covers in our study site. Furthermore, the MV-OBIA also demonstrates a much higher efficiency in utilizing the multi-view information for classification based on its considerably higher overall accuracy compared with BRDF-based methods.

To move from case studies for single cities towards comparative and more operational analyses, generalized models that may be transferred throughout space are desired. In this study, we investigated how single regression models can be spatially generalized for vegetation-impervious-soil (VIS) mapping across multiple cities. The combination of support vector regression (SVR) with synthetically mixed training data generated from spectral libraries was used for fraction mapping. We developed three local models based on separate spectral libraries from Berlin (Germany), Brussels (Belgium), and Santa Barbara (U.S.), and a generalized model based on a combined multi-site spectral library. To examine the performance and transferability of the generalized model compared to local models, we first applied all model variants to simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data from the three cities that were represented in the models, i.e., known sites. Next, we transferred the models to two unknown sites not represented in the models, San Francisco Bay Area (U.S.) and Munich (Germany). In the first mapping constellation, results demonstrated that the generalized model was capable of accurately mapping VIS fractions across all three known sites. Average mean absolute errors (AV-MAEs) were 8.5, 12.2, and 11.0% for Berlin, Brussels, and Santa Barbara. The performance of the generalized model was very similar to the local models, with Delta AV-MAEs falling within a range of +/- 0.7%. A detailed assessment of fraction maps and class-wise accuracies confirmed that modeling errors related to remaining limitations of urban mapping based on optical remote sensing data rather than to the choice between a local or generalized model. For the second mapping constellation, the generalized model proved to be useful for mapping vegetation and impervious fractions in the unknown sites. MAEs for both cover types were 5.4 and 10.9% for the San Francisco Bay Area, and 6.3 and 15.4% for Munich. In contrast, the three local models were only found to have similar accuracies as the generalized model for one of the two sites or for individual VIS categories. Despite the enhanced transferability of the generalized model to the unknown sites, deficiencies remained for accurate soil mapping. MAEs were 22.4 and 12.3%, and high over - and underestimations were observed at the low and high end of the fraction range. These shortcomings indicated possible limitations of the spectral libraries to account for the spectral characteristics of soils in the unknown sites. Overall, we conclude that the combination of SVR and synthetically mixed training data generated from multi-site libraries constitutes a flexible modeling approach for generalized urban mapping across multiple cities.', '[Okujeni, Akpona; Cooper, Sam D.; Hostert, Patrick; van der Linden, Sebastian] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

The method is based on the inversion for the velocity of the heat conservation equation using the altimeter velocities as background. By accurately prescribing the error both on the background velocities and on the forcing term (heat fluxes), the altimeter background velocities are successfully improved in areas characterized by strong SST gradients and remain unchanged in low SST gradient regions, where by construction no additional information may be brought by the SST field. This allows us to provide for the first time a global field of surface velocities from the merging of altimetry and SST. Both the spatial and temporal resolution of the altimeter derived velocities is enhanced by the SST information. Validation is performed through comparison to in-situ drifting buoy velocities. Major improvements (10-20% globally, up to 35% locally) are obtained on the meridional component of the velocity and in the equatorial band. Due to the large uncertainty on the heat fluxes and the spatio-temporal resolution of the input datasets, the high frequency ageostrophic components of the circulation is hardly resolved by the method and, outside the equatorial band, improvements are mainly on the geostrophic component. It is shown that the level of accuracy obtained by combining altimeter velocities based on a two satellite configuration and microwave SST data is equivalent or higher to the one from a four altimeter constellation in western boundary currents. This opens the perspective for a systematic use of the method to improve the altimeter derived surface velocities over the 1993-2001 period, for which only 2 altimeters have been flying simultaneously. Finally, over the recent years, the use of higher resolution SST products based on both microwave and infrared measurements leads to further enhancement of the accuracy of the altimeter velocities on both the zonal and the meridional component in strong SST gradients areas.', '[Rio, M-H] CLS 11 Rue Hermes, F-31520 Ramonville St Agne, France.

Despite the significant improvements in drought modeling over the last decade, accurate provisions of drought conditions in a timely manner is still a major research challenge. In order to improve the current drought monitoring skills, this study presents a land data assimilation system by merging the remotely sensed surface soil moisture with the model simulations with the use of a recently developed particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. To cope with the computational complexity, a modular parallel particle filtering framework (PPFF) is developed which allows a large ensemble size in PMCMC applications. The implementation of the proposed system is demonstrated with the 2012 summer flash drought case study over the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Results from both synthetic and real case studies suggest that the land data assimilation system improves the soil moisture predictions and the drought monitoring skills. Compared with the U.S. Drought Monitoring (USDM), the land data assimilation can better capture the drought onset on May 2012 and the drought severity in June and July 2012.

This problem is overcome in small area estimation (SAE) by linking the variable of interest to auxiliary variables using a model. Two types of models can be distinguished based on the scale on which they operate: i) Unit-level models are applied in the well-known area-based approach (ABA) and are commonly used in forest inventories supported by fine-resolution 3D remote sensing data such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) or digital aerial photogrammetry (AP); ii) Area-level models, where the response is a direct estimate based on a sample within the domain and the explanatory variables are aggregated auxiliary variables, are less frequently applied. Estimators associated with these two model types can make use of sample plots within domains if available and reduce to so-called synthetic estimators in domains where no sample plots are available. We used both model types and their associated model-based estimators in the same study area with AP data as auxiliary variables. Heteroscedasticity, i.e. for continuous dependent variables typically an increasing dispersion of residuals with increasing predictions, is often observed in models linking field- and remotely sensed data. This violates the model assumption that the distribution of the residual errors is constant. Complying with model assumptions is required for model-based methods to result in reliable estimates. Addressing heteroscedasticity in models had considerable impacts on standard errors. When complying with model assumptions, the precision of estimates based on unit-level models was, on average, considerably greater (29%-31% smaller standard errors) than those based on area-level models. Area-level models may nonetheless be attractive because they allow the use of sampling designs that do not easily link to remotely sensed data, such as variable radius plots.', '[Breidenbach, Johannes; Rahlf, Johannes; Astrup, Rasmus] NIBIO, Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Postboks 115, N-1431 As, Norway.

The earthquake occurred at the 1 of 4 high phases of ATSCTF, while the temperature rise came from land surface to high sky. It indicated that the tide force could trigger an earthquake when the tectonic stress was in critical status, and the air temperature rise reflected the terra stress change modulated under the tidal force. During the shock period of ATSCTF, the distribution of air temperature changes both near land surfaces and upper multi-layers along the active fault zones showed a tectonic disturbance pattern of calm before earthquake, rise during earthquake, calm after earthquake as well as a heat distribution pattern of the surface air warmed by land, uplifted by heat flux, cooled and dissipated in the sky. The pattern of changes obeyed the rule of thermal rise of rocks broken under stress loading and the principle of atmospheric thermal dynamic diffusion in vertical. We argued that an earthquake may also be a reason for air temperature differences rather than a simple weather process. At the same time, the rise of air temperature was synchronized with the ATSCTF fluctuant, which showed that tidal force had a particular indicative significance for the identification of temperature anomaly on seismic faults. Because of the mechanical characteristics of the study of earthquake thermal anomalies, it could help to identify the earthquake thermal anomalies and the climatic thermal anomalies, and provided a clear time-indication for the choice of the background temperature in the seismic thermal anomaly recognition.', '[Ma Weiyu; Qi Yao; Chong Yue; Kang, Chunli; Xian Lu] China Earthquake Networks Ctr, Beijing 100045, Peoples R China.

However, 10-day or 35-day water levels derived from satellite radar altimetry are generally too infrequent for flood forecasting or hydrodynamic modelling purposes. This paper proposes a new approach to find daily water levels for areas where in-situ river heights are not available. The new approach is based on the relationship between river height and difference between daytime and night time land surface temperatures (LST). This relationship is first demonstrated using in-situ gauge data to explore appropriate statistical models to predict river height using LST differences. The approach is then applied to a number of virtual stations at the intersections between the Mekong River and the ground-tracks of Jason-2 satellite altimetry which gives 10-day water level time series.   The LST difference from the thermal infrared (TIR) observations of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is shown to have a strong relationship with in-situ water levels and a good relationship with the Jason-2 water levels. The models included a simple linear regression model which was then extended to firstly include seasonal terms and secondly assimilate satellite altimetry data. A regression model tree (M5) was also considered but was found to be inferior to the seasonal linear model. The developed regression models were used to predict daily water levels to infill the 10-day Jason-2 altimeters. RMSE of modelled daily water levels at gauges is between 0.3 m to 0.6 m, while RMSE of modelled daily water levels without using in-situ data is higher varying from 1.4 m to 1.9 m. The temporal correlation between the modelled water levels using satellite altimeters at virtual stations and in-situ water levels at adjacent gauges ranged from 0.72 to 0.86. These results show the potential of the proposed approach to produce high temporal resolution water levels for flood models or other applications using only remotely sensed data.', '[Pham, Hung T.; Marshall, Lucy; Johnson, Fiona; Sharma, Ashish] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.

To determine contributions from these interactions, we used space-borne remotely sensed vegetation indices to monitor leaf development across climate gradients and ecoregions in the southeastern United States. We quantified how air temperature, drought severity, and canopy thermal stress contribute to changes in leaf flushing from mountainous to coastal plain regions by developing a hierarchical state-space Bayesian model. We synthesized daily field climate data with daily vegetation indices and canopy surface temperature during spring green-up season at 59 sites in the southeastern United States between 2001 and 2012. Our results demonstrated strong interaction effects between ecosystem properties and climate variables across ecoregions. We found spring green-up is faster in the mountains, while coastal forests express a larger sensitivity to inter-annual temperature anomalies. Despite our detection of a decreasing trend in sensitivity to warming with temperature in all regions, we identified an ecosystem interaction: Deciduous dominated forests are less sensitive to warming than are those with fewer deciduous trees, likely due to the continuous presence of leaves in evergreen species throughout the season. Mountainous forest green-up is more susceptible to intensifying drought and moisture deficit, while coastal areas are relatively resilient.

This study takes advantage of three wildfires, 900-5300 km(2) in extent, containing very severely affected areas, occurring in semi-evergreen, eucalypt-dominated, tropical Australian savanna, which resulted in significant areas of complete canopy scorch, very significant tree stem mortality (24-55%), and associated loss of living above ground biomass (47-69%) at respective sites.

Mapping of internal fire (unburnt) patchiness was enhanced with finer resolution Landsat imagery, but the much longer orbital return cycle precluded its use at two of the three sites given extended cloudy conditions. Application of an automated MODIS-derived fire severity mapping algorithm (overall reliability in 2015 = 75%) calibrated for generalised north Australian savanna conditions, suggests that 15% and 12% of Australia\'s 1.3 M km(2) tropical savannas region were burnt by severe fires in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

With bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) spectra, some researchers attempted to invert PROSPECT after a modification to the latest version of the model. However, the retrieval accuracy varies greatly with chemical constituents and can be low for some of them, such as dry matter content. This paper proposes a new approach called PROCWT by coupling PROSPECT with continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to suppress the surface reflectance effect and enhance the absorption features of chemical constituents. Instead of the reflectance spectra, the wavelet coefficient spectra generated after CWT were used to construct the merit function for model inversion. Given that the multi-scale decomposition of CWT enables enhancement of chemical-specific absorption features, the use of PROCWT at different scales of wavelet decomposition could lead to improved retrievals of biochemical parameters. The performance of PROCWT was evaluated for estimating foliar chemicals of wheat and rice crops from BRF spectra measured with a leaf clip equipped spectrometer over a two-year field experiment. PROCWT was also compared with the standard PROSPECT inversion (STANDARD), the PROSPECT inversion with the subtraction of surface reflectance (PROREF), and the simplified PROCOSINE (sPROCOSINE).   Our results demonstrated that the contribution of surface reflectance component was significant for BRF spectra and the effect of surface reflectance could be suppressed by PROCWT as well as PROREF and sPROCOSINE. Compared with STANDARD, PROCWT and the two traditional methods significantly improved the retrieval accuracies for pigments and leaf water content, but only PROCWT produced significant improvement for dry matter content with a decrease of 14.79 g/m(2) in the root mean squared error (RMSE) (30% of the mean) over the entire experimental dataset by enhancing dry matter absorption features. High scales of wavelet decomposition were favorable for the estimation of carotenoid and water contents and low scales for the estimation of chlorophyll and dry matter contents. The difference in optimal scale revealed the separation of overlapping absorption features attributed to various chemical constituents. In addition, the newest PROSPECT-D outperformed PROSPECT-5B in the retrieval of chlorophyll content but not for carotenoid. This new physically based approach could be beneficial to analysts attempting to retrieve leaf chemicals from BRF spectra alone and close-range reflectance imagery of crops and even other vegetation types.', '[Li, Dong; Cheng, Tao; Jia, Min; Zhou, Kai; Lu, Ning; Yao, Xia; Tian, Yongchao; Zhu, Yan; Cao, Weixing] Nanjing Agr Univ, Minist Agr, Jiangsu Key Lab Informat Agr, NETCIA,Key Lab Crop Syst Anal & Decis Making, One Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.', 'Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Nanjing Agricultural UniversityRP Cheng, T (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Minist Agr, Jiangsu Key Lab Informat Agr, NETCIA,Key Lab Crop Syst Anal & Decis Making, One Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.', 'tcheng@njau.edu.cnRI Cheng, Tao/B-4807-2010; Li, Dong/GWN-0268-2022; Zhu, Yan/AAK-6927-2020', 'Cheng, Tao/0000-0002-4184-0730; Li, Dong/0000-0002-3897-7322; Zhu,   Yan/0000-0002-8912-3888; Zhou, Kai/0000-0001-8194-2662', 'National Key RD Program [2016YFD0300601]; National Natural Science   Foundation of China [31470084, 31725020]; Fundamental Research Funds for   the Central Universities [KYLH201603]; Jiangsu Distinguished Professor   Program; Special Program for Agriculture Science and Technology from   Ministry of Agriculture in China [201303109]; Jiangsu Collaborative   Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production; Academic Program   Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)', 'This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program   (2016YFD0300601), the National Natural Science Foundation of China   (31470084, 31725020), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central   Universities (KYLH201603), Jiangsu Distinguished Professor Program,   Special Program for Agriculture Science and Technology from Ministry of   Agriculture in China (201303109), Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation   Center for Modern Crop Production, and the Academic Program Development   of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

However, empirical evidence exists that passive microwave soil moisture retrievals are prone to periodic artifacts which may complicate their application in data assimilation systems (which commonly treat observational errors as being temporally white). In this paper, the link between such temporally-periodic errors and spatial land surface heterogeneity is examined. Both the synthetic experiment and site-specified cases reveal that, when combined with strong spatial heterogeneity, temporal periodicity in satellite sampling patterns (associated with exact repeat intervals of the polar-orbiting satellites) can lead to spurious high frequency spectral peaks in soil moisture retrievals. In addition, the global distribution of the most prominent and consistent 8-day spectral peak in the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System soil moisture retrievals is revealed via a peak detection method. Three spatial heterogeneity indicators based on microwave brightness temperature, land cover types, and long-term averaged vegetation index are proposed to characterize the degree to which the variability of land surface is capable of inducing periodic error into satellite-based soil moisture retrievals. Regions demonstrating 8-day periodic errors are generally consistent with those exhibiting relatively higher heterogeneity indicators. This implies a causal relationship between spatial land surface heterogeneity and temporal periodic error in remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals.', '[Lei, Fangni; Crow, Wade T.] USDA ARS, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.

In this study, we aimed to develop a sub-pixel method for estimating the planting fraction of paddy rice in Northeast China. This method assumes low seasonal variations in moisture in paddy rice fields compared with other upland crops due to the presence of flooding water throughout the growing season. We used the coefficient of variation (CV) of the land surface water index (LSWI) derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) to indicate the water condition. High resolution images obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were used to test this assumption and to develop the relationship between the CV of LSWI and the planting fraction of paddy rice. The results showed that the CV of LSWI could effectively indicate the planting fraction of paddy rice, where our method explained 84% of the variation in the planting fraction of paddy rice in the UAV survey sites. Validation based on the statistical data showed that this method explained 78% and 85% of the variations in the paddy rice area at the county and prefecture levels, respectively.

The data have been collected between 2011 and 2016 in bistatic stripmap single polarization (HH) mode, with the main goal of generating a consistent, timely, and highly accurate 3D representation of the global terrain\'s surface (digital elevation model, DEM). The global data set of quicklook images, which represent a spatially averaged version of the original full resolution data at a ground independent pixel spacing of 50 m x 50 m, was used as input, in order to limit the computational burden. For classification purposes, several observables, systematically provided by the TanDEM-X system, can be exploited, such as the calibrated amplitude, the digital elevation model (DEM), and the interferometric coherence. Among the several factors contributing to a coherence degradation in InSAR data, the so-called volume correlation factor quantifies the coherence loss due to volume scattering phenomena, which typically occur in presence of vegetation. This quantity is directly derived from the interferometric coherence and used as main indicator for the identification of vegetated areas. For this purpose, a fuzzy multi-clustering classification approach, which takes into account the geometry and acquisition configuration, is applied to each acquired scene separately. A certain variability of the interferometric coherence at X band was observed among different forest types, mainly due to changes in forest structure, density, and tree height, which led to an adjustment of the algorithm settings depending on the considered type of forest. The identification of additional information layers, such as urban settlements or water areas, is also discussed, and the procedure for mosaicking of over-lapping acquisitions (two at global scale, up to ten over mountainous terrain, forests, and desert regions) to improve the classification accuracy is detailed. The resulting global forest/non-forest map was validated using external reference information as well as with other existing classification maps and an overall agreement was observed that often exceeds 90%. Finally, examples for high-resolution (at 12 m x 12 m) forest maps and potentials for deforestation monitoring over selected regions are presented as well, demonstrating the unique capabilities offered by the TanDEM-X bistatic system for a broad range of geoinformation services and scientific applications.

Lidar-based statistical models have been used to accurately estimate AGB in large spatial extents, especially in boreal and temperate softwood forest ecosystems. However, the few available models for temperate hardwood and hardwood-dominated mixed forests are low in accuracy due both to the deliquescent growth form of hardwood trees and the strong site-to-site variations in height-diameter relationship. In this study, we established multiplicative nonlinear regression models that incorporated both lidar-derived metrics and soil-based site productivity classes (high and low productivity sites) to estimate aboveground biomass in temperate hardwood forests. The final optimized model had high accuracy (R-2 = 0.81; RMSE = 45.5 Mg ha(-1)) with reliable performance in ABG estimation by integrating relative height metrics at 75 and 70 percentiles (RH75 and RH70), canopy coverage and site productivity class. An optimized model that included an index of site productivity explained 14% more variance than the best-fit model without the term. Moreover, the relationship between AGB and lidar-based metrics was nonlinear on low productivity sites and nearly linear on high productivity sites, further indicating the importance of including direct or indirect measures of site productivity in lidar-based biomass models, particularly for those applied to temperate hardwood forests.

Here we present a framework for estimating populations from the bottom up, entirely independently of national census data, a critical need in areas without recent and reliable census data. To make observations of population density, we replace national census data with a microcensus, in which we enumerate population for a sample of small areas within the states of Kano and Kaduna in northern Nigeria. Using supervised texture-based classifiers with very high resolution satellite imagery, we produce a binary map of human settlement at 8-meter resolution across the two states and then a more refined classification consisting of 7 residential types and 1 non-residential type. Using the residential types and a model linking them to the population density observations, we produce population estimates across the two states in a gridded raster format, at approximately 90-meter resolution. We also demonstrate a simulation framework for capturing uncertainty and presenting estimates as prediction intervals for any region of interest of any size and composition within the study region.

This is based on a modified version of the gamma index that could be suitable for fitness-for-purpose assessment given that one can choose various criteria depending on applications.   The method is first presented and then applied to both land and atmospheric ECVs. The terrestrial analysis concerns the global surface albedo, using monthly white-sky surface albedo in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave broadband spectral ranges at a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees using three sources of products. The latter study is conducted using monthly aerosol optical depth (ADD) products at 550 nm at a spatial resolution of 1 with four different datasets at the global scale. The analysis shows how the values of the gamma criteria impact the spatial and temporal results.   As an example, if the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) actual target measurements uncertainty is used as an acceptance criteria for the intensity tolerance the results show that: 1) the seasonal agreement for the surface albedo products varies over 20% to 40% of the terrestrial surface in the shortwave and near infrared broadband and from 10% to 30% in the visible one and 2) the three aerosols optical depth products agree with the reference one for over 50% of the land surface only when the tolerance distance term is at 224km.

Accurate mapping of ash species is required to monitor the host resource, predict EAB spread and better understand the short- and long-term effects of EAB on the ash resource. Hyperspectral remote sensing technologies have been used to successfully map forest species, although most efforts are focused on healthy canopies for relatively homogeneous forested stands. This study uses imagery collected by the NASA Goddard LiDAR, Hyperspectral and Thermal (GLiHT) airborne imager to map ash species at the tree level in an EAB infested urban setting. The overall goal of the study is to understand how canopy condition impacts species mapping accuracy and identify data collection and image processing techniques to more accurately map the location of ash species in infested regions.   Results indicate that while overall independent validation mapping accuracy of ash and non-ash trees was 81%, correct identification of ash canopies dropped from 62% for vigor 1 trees to 22% for vigor 2 trees. To minimize these errors, we developed a multiple endmember, spectral unmixing technique to overcome challenges presented by a spectrally complicated target in a complex urban environment. This hinges on the use of endmember spectra from trees across a range of canopy condition, including the derivation of vegetation indices to inform the spectral unmixing calibration. This approach was more accurate than calibrations performed using traditional unmixing based only on pure endmember spectra.   Implications for this work suggest that urban forest managers may attain more accurate maps by conducting remote sensing data collections prior to infestation while the trees are still healthy. Where this is not possible, mapping efforts must reflect a range of canopy conditions and include vegetation indices concurrent with reflectance data. The resulting ash species maps provide urban forest managers spatially explicit products to help estimate the extent of possible impacts in their communities, guide the implementation of management and monitoring efforts and provide the basis for planning as EAB continues to spread.', '[Pontius, Jennifer] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, US Forest Serv, USDA,Northern Res Stn, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.

The Alaska National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 was the first 30-m resolution baseline land cover product of the entire state derived from circa 2001 Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary data. We developed a comprehensive approach named AKUP11 to update Alaska NLCD from 2001 to 2011 and provide a 10-year cyclical update of the state\'s land cover and land cover changes. Our method is designed to characterize the main land cover changes associated with different drivers, including the conversion of forests to shrub and grassland primarily as a result of wildland fire and forest harvest, the vegetation successional processes after disturbance, and changes of surface water extent and glacier ice/snow associated with weather and climate changes. For natural vegetated areas, a component named AKUP11-VEG was developed for updating the land cover that involves four major steps: 1) identify the disturbed and successional areas using Landsat images and ancillary datasets; 2) update the land cover status for these areas using a SKILL model (System of Knowledge-based Integrated -trajectory Land cover Labeling); 3) perform decision tree classification; and 4) develop a final land cover and land cover change product through the postprocessing modeling. For water and ice/snow areas, another component named AKUP11-WIS was developed for initial land cover change detection, removal of the terrain shadow effects, and exclusion of ephemeral snow changes using a 3-year MODIS snow extent dataset from 2010 to 2012. The overall approach was tested in three pilot study areas in Alaska, with each area consisting of four Landsat image footprints. The results from the pilot study show that the overall accuracy in detecting change and no-change is 90% and the overall accuracy of the updated land cover label for 2011 is 86%. The method provided a robust, consistent, and efficient means for capturing major disturbance events and updating land cover for Alaska. The method has subsequently been applied to generate the land cover\" and land cover change products for the entire state of Alaska. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigates the potential of hyperspectral techniques for detecting leaves at the stages of freezing and post-thawing injury, and for quantifying the impacts of freezing injury on leaf water and pigment contents. Four experiments were carried out to acquire hyperspectral reflectance and biochemical parameters for oilseed rape plants subjected to freezing treatment. Principal component analysis and support vector machines were applied to raw reflectance, first and second derivatives (SDR), and inverse logarithmic reflectance to differentiate freezing and the different stages of post-thawing from the normal leaf state. The impacts on biochemical retrieval using particular spectral domains were also assessed using a multivariate analysis. Results showed that SDR generated the highest classification accuracy (>95.6%) in the detection of post-thawed leaves. The optimal ratio vegetation index (RVI) generated the highest predictive accuracy for changes in leaf water content, with a cross validated coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.85 and a cross validated root mean square error (RMSECV) of 2.4161 mg/cm(2). Derivative spectral indices outperformed multivariate statistical methods for the estimation of changes in pigment contents. The highest accuracy was found between the optimal RVI and the change in carotenoids content (R-cv(2) = 0.70 and RMSECV = 0.0015 mg/cm(2)). The spectral domain 400-900 nm outperformed the full spectrum in the estimation of individual pigment contents, and hence this domain can be used to reduce redundancy and increase computational efficiency in future operational scenarios. Our findings indicate that hyperspectral remote sensing has considerable potential for characterizing freezing injury in oilseed rape, and this could form a basis for developing satellite remote sensing products for crop monitoring.

In this paper, we investigate the spatio-temporal behavior of the long-term displacement field at Piton de la Fournaise volcano (12 Reunion Island) by means of X-band InSAR and GNSS time series analysis from 2009 to 2014. We propose a new correction approach based on principal component analysis to mitigate the long-wavelength artifact in the interferograms over the study area. Our results show that most of the volcanic edifice including the Central Cone, the Eastern Flank and recent lava flow fields was affected by varying degrees of ground motion. More importantly, a widespread sector (similar to 20 km(2)) affected by time-dependent downward and eastward motion was observed on the Eastern Flank of Piton de la Fournaise. The combined analysis of InSAR and GNSS time series and previous studies allows us to confirm that this large mobile sector on the Eastern Flank underwent deformation for at least 7 years following the end of the large March-April 2007 eruption, including a stage of transient strain from the end of eruption to February 2011, followed by a stage of steady-state strain until late 2014. Several possible origins, including a pre-existing structural discontinuity, summit stress associated with magmatism, and activated fault movement are explored to explain the observed widespread long-term seaward motion that is considered to be direct evidence of potential flank instability.

Mapping and monitoring of slum areas have become an invaluable source for decision-making processes to implement policies related to improve living conditions. Space-borne remotely sensed data has been explored in the past for slum mapping, however, to a large extent supported by optical imagery. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of dual-polarized (HH/VV and W/VH) X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from TerraSAR-X images for slum extent mapping using the Kennaugh element framework for image preprocessing. In this way, spatial image descriptors based on texture, morphological profiles and polarimetric features have been tested at various window sizes [11 x 11,...,161 x 1611 for mapping slums using the random forest classifier in a series of experiments. For benchmarking the classification results, LDA as parametric linear classifier is used for comparison. Classification performance was evaluated by comparison with a reference map indicating that texture features hold the highest contribution to discriminating slums from other urban structures. Best window size was found using a spatial neighborhood of 81 x 81 pixels resulting in Overall Accuracy of 88.58 and Kappa of 0.7809 for RF classifier. A patch-based analysis of classification results reveals areal dependencies of the classifier in terms of larger slum patches that are mapped with higher precision than smaller patches. Analyses including additional spatial image descriptors based on mathematical profiles reveal no significant contribution to the classification result. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

So far, most studies of temporal changes in nighttime lights were focused on examining inter-annual trends or on sudden changes in light emission, related to demographic and economic reasons. Here, the recently released two year (2014-2015) set of monthly cloud-free VIIRS-DNB composites was used to explicitly examine seasonal changes in nighttime lights and their correspondence with seasonality of land cover in Northern and Central America. It was found that monthly changes in nighttime brightness were positively correlated with monthly changes in snow cover and in albedo, and negatively correlated with monthly changes in NDVI. These correlations were strongest in urban areas in the northeast of the USA, where high correlation coefficient values (>0.8) were obtained. Seasonality in nighttime brightness is thus an important factor to consider both when quantifying trends in light emission from annual time series, and in studies examining the adverse consequences of artificial lights on human health and on the environment.

The quality of the R-rs products has not, however, been extensively assessed. This manuscript provides a comprehensive evaluation of Level-1B, i.e., top of atmosphere reflectance, and R-rs products available from OLI imagery under near-ideal atmospheric conditions in moderately turbid waters. The procedure includes a) evaluations of the R-rs products at sites included in the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC), b) intercomparisons and cross-calibrations against other ocean color products, and c) optimizations of vicarious calibration gains across the entire OLI observing swath. Results indicate that the near-infrared and shortwave infrared (NIR-SWIR) band combinations yield the most robust and stable R-rs retrievals in moderately turbid waters. Intercomparisons against products derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua platform (MODISA) indicate slight across-track non-uniformities (<1%) associated with OLI scenes in the blue bands. In both product domains (TOA and R-rs), on average, the OLI products were found larger in radiometric responses in the blue channels. Following the implementation of updated vicarious calibration gains and accounting for across-track non-uniformities, matchup analyses using independent in-situ validation data confirmed improvements in R-rs products. These findings further support high-fidelity OLI-derived aquatic science products in terms of both demonstrating a robust atmospheric correction method and providing consistent products across OLI\'s imaging swath.

However, because of the complex interaction of land-atmosphere systein and the contamination of cloud cover, the retrieval of daytime T-a exclusively from remote sensing data is still far from straight forward, especially under cloudy sky conditions. In this paper, we presented a simple parameterization scheme of daytime T-a under all-weather conditions entirely based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. To evaluate its applicability, the scheme was demonstrated in two regions with totally different geomorphological and climatic conditions, the east part of the Qaidam Basin (EQB) in China and the Southern Great Plains (SGP) in the United States of America. The instantaneous T-a under clear sky conditions (T-a,T-clear) was determined as the average of near surface air temperature (T-a(s)) retrieved from MOD07_L2 product and land surface temperature (T-s) retrieved from MOD06_12 product. Then a regression model between T-a,T-clear and T-s was established, and the instantaneous Ta under cloudy sky conditions (T-a,T-cloudy) was estimated by applying the regression model to T-s retrieved under cloudy sky conditions. The results showed that the averaging parameterization scheme has significantly improved the accuracy of T-a,T-clear retrievals with MAE = 1.95 degrees C, RMSE = 2.50 degrees C, and B = 0.02 in the EQB, and MAE = 2.02 degrees C, RMSE = 2.56 degrees C, and B = 0.01 in the SGP. The T-a,T-cloudy estimates also showed good agreement with T-a observations in both regions with a correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.91. The values of RMSE calculated for the EQB and SGP were 3.42 degrees C and 2.91 degrees C, respectively. The accuracy of both T-a,T-clear and T-a,T-cloudy estimates has reached a level comparable with other traditional statistical approaches that adopt ancillary T-a measurements as training dataset. Therefore, it is feasible to estimate daytime T-a under all-weather conditions entirely based on MODIS products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, a novel signal processing method is used to correctly measure 3D voxelised vegetation cover from full-waveform ALS data at 1.5 m horizontal and 50 cm vertical resolution, including understorey vegetation and within-canopy structure. A new method for calibrating and validating the instrument specific ALS processing using high resolution TLS data is also presented and used to calibrate and validate the ALS derived data products over a wide range of land cover types within a heterogeneous urban area, including woodland, gardens and streets. This showed the method to accurately retrieve voxelised canopy cover maps with less than 0.4% of voxels containing false negatives, 10% of voxels containing false positives and a canopy cover accuracy within voxels of 24%. The method was applied across 100 km2 and the resulting structure maps were compared to the more widely used discrete return ALS and Gaussian decomposed waveform ALS data products. These products were found to give little information on the within-canopy structure and so are only capable of deriving coarse resolution, plot-scale structure metrics. The detailed 3D canopy maps derived from the new method allow landscape scale ecosystem processes to be examined in more detail than has previously been possible, and the new method reveals details about the canopy understorey, creating opportunities for ecological investigations. The calibration method can be applied to any waveform ALS instrument and processing method.

Despite the great efforts over the past few years, there is room for improvement in its accuracy and efficiency. Existing LM is primarily achieved using field surveys or visual interpretation of remote sensing images. However, such methods are highly labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly over large areas. Thus, in this paper a change detection-based Markov random field (CDMRF) method is proposed for near-automatic LM from aerial orthophotos. The proposed CDMRF is applied to a landslide-prone site with an area of approximately 40 km2 on Lantau Island, Hong Kong. Compared with the existing region-based level set evolution (RLSE), it has three main advantages: 1) it employs a more robust threshold method to generate the training samples; 2) it can identify landslides more accurately as it takes advantages of both the spectral and spatial contextual information of landslides; and 3) it needs little parameter tuning. Quantitative evaluation shows that it outperforms RLSE in the whole study area by almost 5.5% in Correctness and by 4% in Quality. To our knowledge, it is the first time CDMRF is used to LM from bitemporal aerial photographs. It is highly generic and has great potential for operational LM applications in large areas and also can be adapted for other sources of imagery data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The proposed Modified-IMSRA (M-IMSRA) algorithm deviates from original IMSRA in two ways: first is by improvement in rain/no-rain area detection scheme using a Multi Index Rain Detection (MIRD) index; second is based on the climate region-wise correction through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) models developed for each climate regions using rainfall (obtained based on first improvement) and static topographic variables extracted from Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The overall results indicate that the M-IMSRA is performing better than the IMSRA in all climatic regions when compared with the IMD gridded gauge data. However, the improvement is not uniform in all the regions. The inclusion of the MIRD index led to considerable improvement in M-IMSRA-based rainfall estimates mainly in the arid regions. Likewise, the results obtained after the LASSO regression corrections indicate that they are necessary only for the orographic regions where significant improvements are observed in the rainfall estimates. Finally, the inter-comparison of the simple hybrid M-IMSRA estimates with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 V7 and TRMM 3B42-RT V7 illustrates that the M-IMSRA performs nearly as well as even better (except in terms of Correlation Coefficient) than the complex multi-satellite-based rainfall estimates in all the climate regions of India. Considering the above results, it can be said that the performance of simple hybrid algorithms such as IMSRA can be improved to match the quality or even outperform complex multi-satellite rainfall estimates by incorporating appropriate corrections.

Simplified classification approaches based on threshold levels of backscattering intensity are typical in operational flood monitoring. Backscattering intensity from floods over open non-forested areas is typically lower, whereas backscatter from forest floods is higher compared to non-flooded areas. However, distinction of flooded areas from non-flooded surface in semi-forested areas with low canopy closure (CC) or low tree height (TH) is expected to be difficult due to confounding effects of the different scattering mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate X-band SAR backscattering in flooded boreal forests with varying TH and CC, and to quantify in which cases floods would be difficult to detect with typical threshold-based classification methods. To further understand the SAR signal behavior in flooded forests, the total backscatter was modeled using the HUT (Helsinki University of Technology) semi-empirical forest backscattering model. HH-polarized Cosmo Sky-Med acquisitions from four different locations in Finland were analyzed against airborne LiDAR based forest data, ground observations and a high resolution digital elevation model. Floods were well detected in open areas and dense forests. However, as hypothesized, when TH was higher than zero but lower than 4-5 m, or when CC was higher than zero but lower than 15-20%, the detection was less successful. TH was found to have slightly more influence on the capability of X-band SAR to detect floods than CC. In our four test areas, namely Kittila, Kolari, Pudasjarvi and Evo, 853%, 89.1%, 82.7% and 73.9% of the total floods were detected, respectively, by a simple threshold value method. The model was able to successfully estimate the different backscattering components of the flooded forests in Kittila and Pudasjarvi, where the number of observations from all forest conditions was sufficient.

Based on the previously demonstrated capability of NASA\'s UAVSAR polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PoISAR) image data to map Spartina alterniflora marsh canopy structure, structure maps combining the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution (IAD, orientation) were constructed for yearly intervals that were directly relatable to the 2010 LAI-LAD classification. The yearly LAI-LAD and LAI difference maps were used to investigate causes for the previously revealed dramatic change in marsh structure from prespill (2009) to postspill (2010, spill cessation), and the occurrence of structure features that exhibited abnormal spatial and temporal patterns. Water level and salinity records showed that freshwater releases used to keep the oil offshore did not cause the rapid growth from 2009 to 2010 in marsh surrounding the inner Bay. Photointerpretation of optical image data determined that interior marsh patches exhibiting rapid change were caused by burns and burn recovery, and that the pattern of 2010 to 2011 1AI decreases in backshore marsh and extending along some tidal channels into the interior marsh were not associated with burns. Instead, the majority of 2010 to 2011 shoreline features aligned with vectors displaying the severity of 2010 shoreline oiling from the DWH spill. Although the association is not conclusive of a causal oil impact, the coexistent pattern is a significant discovery. PoISAR marsh structure mapping provided a unique perspective of marsh biophysical status that enhanced detection of change and monitoring of trends important to management effectiveness.

A pure-panel survey based on point sampling is adopted. An initial sample of points is selected by means of tessellation stratified sampling (TSS). The sample points are classified based on the imagery available for the years of interest to estimate land-cover or land-use proportions and their changes. To reduce the sampling effort, the initial selection of points is viewed as the first phase of sampling and a subsample of these points is selected in a second phase by means of one-per-stratum stratified sampling (OPSS). Land-use estimation at any subsequent year is then based on the classifications performed on the points of the second-phase sample. Two-phase estimators of proportions and of their changes are suggested, and their theoretical properties are derived. Presumably conservative estimators of their variances are proposed. A check of the precision lost involved when changing from one- to two-phase sampling is determined from the assessment of land use in Italy as a case study and from an artificial population generated to resemble the current land-use situation in Italy.

Motivated by the pressing need to understand, from a hydro-ecological perspective, the impact of the dynamic nature of the hydrologic cycle on the environment in water-stressed regions, we investigated how different habitats in East Africa behave under extreme hydrologic conditions. We assessed the hydro-ecological vulnerability of the region by studying the response of soil moisture and vegetation water content to precipitation deficiency. The spatial patterns and characteristics of the inter-relations among the three aforementioned hydrologic variables, as well as the sensitivity and resilience of vegetation water content and soil moisture, derived from WindSat, were investigated for different vegetation types during dry spells of varying duration, identified using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), in 2003-2011. Forest/Woody Savanna (FWS) and Savanna/Grasslands (SG) are more sensitive to local hydrologic extremes, while Shrublands (SHR) and the soils that support it are the least impacted by these conditions. SG and FWS exhibit the highest vegetation water content resilience, whereas soil moisture persistence during dry spells is at its highest in SHR/SG. The environmental variability, illustrated by the spatial patterns of the aforementioned hydrologic properties, can potentially play a role in the enhancement of resilience. This study provides critical insight into the hydro-ecological vulnerability of East Africa using microwave remote sensing, and this information can be used towards advancing management and decision support systems that would improve societal well-being and economic development.

In this study, we develop a suite of methods to evaluate the combination of Landsat-8, ALOS PALSAR, and SRTM data for mapping spatial distribution of mangrove composition, canopy height, and aboveground biomass in the wide intertidal zones and coastal plains of Mimika district, Papua, Indonesia. Image segmentation followed by visual interpretation of composite PALSAR images was used to delineate mangrove areas, whereas a flexible statistical rule based classification of spectral signatures from Landsat-8 images was used to classify mangrove associations. The overall accuracy of land cover classification was 94.38% with a kappa coefficient of 0.94 when validated with field inventory data and Google Earth images. Mangrove height and aboveground biomass were mapped using the SRTM DEM, which were calibrated with field-measured data via quantile regression models. There was a strong correlation between the SRTM DEM and the 0.98 quantile of field canopy heights (H-.98), which was used to represent the tallest trees in each of 196 10 m radius subplots (r = 0.84 and R-2 = 0.804). Model performance was evaluated through 10,000 bootstrapped simulations, producing a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.0 m for canopy height estimation over 30 m pixels of SRTM data. Quantile regression revealed a relatively strong non-linear relationship between the SRTM derived canopy height model and aboveground biomass measured in 0.5 ha mangrove inventory plots (n = 33, R-2 = 0.46). The model results produced estimates of mean standing biomass of 237.52 +/- 982 Mg/ha in short canopy (Avicennia/Sonneratia) stands to 353.52 +/- 98.43 Mg/ha in mature tall canopy (Rhizophora) dominated forest. The model estimates of mangrove biomass were within 90% confidence intervals of area-weighted biomass derived from field measurements. When validated at the landscape scale, the difference between modeled and measured aboveground mangrove biomass was 3.48% with MAE of 105.75 Mg/ha. These results indicate that the approaches developed here are reliable for mapping and monitoring mangrove composition, height, and biomass over large areas of Indonesia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study evaluates the utility of postfire regrowth trajectories, derived from multi-temporal Landsat satellite surface reflectance imagery, as a basis for estimating postfire recovery of chamise chaparral in southern California. Postfire recovery metrics are applied to time series trajectories of spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) including NDVI, EVI, SAVI, MSAVI, NBR, and NBR2. Shrub fractional cover changes following postfire recovery are estimated at 74 plots using multi date high spatial resolution orthoimagery, enabling stratification of the recovery outcomes. The sensitivity of Landsat-based regrowth trajectories to postfire shrub recovery is assessed by ANOVA statistical testing based on the stratified recovery outcomes. We evaluate several combinations of postfire recovery metrics and SVIs as postfire recovery indicators. We compare SVI trends extending 19 to 29 years postfire with field-collected data on postfire recovery trends reported in previous studies, in order to assess the sensitivity of the SVIs to short and long-term phases of regrowth. The utility and necessity of normalizing SVI time series based on unburned control plots to reduce moisture effects is also evaluated.   A primary finding is that the Scaled Recovery Metric (SRM), a variant of the Regeneration Index which incorporates the pixel-specific SVI value immediately after fire, is a particularly useful indicator of postfire recovery based on time-sequential SVI trajectories and facilitates inter-site comparisons. Time series of several SVIs (especially NDVI and NBR2) provide statistically significant (p < 0.05) indications of postfire recovery outcomes when post fire recovery metrics are applied; NDVI and NBR2 are also sensitive to the gradual regrowth of chamise up to 12 and 19 years postfire, respectively. Normalization by unburned control plots reduces the correlation of Landsat SVIs with annual precipitation by 25 to 70% and enhances recovery signals, but locating suitable control plots was difficult in many parts of our study area. NBR2 is useful for postfire recovery assessment without normalizing by control plots. This study provides an overview of some advantages, limitations, and technical considerations for using postfire regrowth trajectories from Landsat imagery to assess long-term impacts of fire on chamise chaparral.

Repeated monitoring of saltcedar distribution over region-wide geographic areas is urgently essential for conservation agencies to develop cost-effective control strategies. Current studies have mostly concentrated on the mapping of saltcedar distribution with a single remote sensing image acquired during its leaf senescence. Given the phenological variation within saltcedar and the spectral confusion between saltcedar and natives, our ability to detect saltcedar with a single-date image is still limited. The objective of this study was to develop new intra-annual phenology-based strategies to detect exotic saltcedar with monthly time series of Landsat imagery. Several temporal phenology-based detection strategies (i.e., phenological bands, phenological NDVI, and phenological metrics) that could track the intra-annual phenological trajectory of plants were devised. With the proposed detection strategies, crucial months and phenological stages in saltcedar detection were investigated. Results indicated that the proposed strategy of phenological bands could accommodate the phenological variation within saltcedar and improve the classification accuracy significantly. Several phenological stages (e.g., flowering and leaf senescence) were deemed as important in discriminating saltcedar from other riparian plants at the Landsat scale. The proposed strategy was found to be relatively robust to the lack of a single Landsat image. It is concluded that monthly time series of Landsat imagery are promising in facilitating the long-term mapping of saltcedar distribution over extended areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The thermal anisotropy at a satellite pixel scale (e.g. 1 km) is hard to quantify with current techniques through airborne observations and modeling. The various anisotropic features over urban and rural surfaces lead to an uncertainty regarding how this anisotropy of land surface temperature (LST) influences estimates of the surface urban heat island (SUHI). We quantify LST anisotropy over Chicago and New York using MODIS LST products during the warm months (May-September) for a 10-year period. The impacts of atmospheric attenuation and daily weather variability on LST are removed in order to isolate the anisotropic signal. We then calculate the anisotropy for different levels of urban land use intensity. The daytime maximum anisotropic effects can be up to 9 K for the most urbanized areas, while the nighttime anisotropic effects are weaker but still discernible. Two anisotropic \"hot spot\" features are observed during daytime: one corresponds to the sensor-sun geometric effect with a higher proportion of sunlit surface components been seen a given view configuration, and the other occurs when sensor zenith angles are near nadir in the afternoon. Similar anisotropic features between the two cities confirm the broader applicability of our approach, while some unique features specific to each city emphasize that diverse urban surface properties and geographic settings can affect anisotropy. This study is the first of its kind to directly evaluate the influence of directional anisotropy on satellite-retrieved SUHI measurements, demonstrating that anisotropic effects can possibly modify the SUHI as measured with MODIS LST by 2.3 K, which is about 25-50% of the total magnitude of the SUHI over Chicago and New York. Our findings provide a statistical basis for the quantification of satellite-retrieved LST anisotropy over heterogeneous urban environments globally. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

More specifically, this study investigated the ability of physically based statistical regressions to retrieve SSM from two passive microwave remote sensing observations: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E; 2003-Sept. 2011) and the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. Regression coefficients were calibrated using AMSR-E horizontal and vertical brightness temperature (TB) observations and SMOS level 3 SSM (SMOSL3; as a training dataset). This calibration process was carried out over the June 2010-Sept. 2011 period, over which both SMOS and AMSR-E observations coincide. Based on these calibrated coefficients, a global SSM product (referred here to as AMSR-reg) was computed from the AMSR-E TB observations during the 2003-2011 period. The regression quality was assessed by evaluating the AMSR-reg SSM product against the SMOSL3 SSM product over the period of calibration, in terms of correlation (R) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). A good agreement (mean global R = 0.60 and mean global RMSE = 0.057 m(3)/m(3)), was obtained between the AMSR-reg and SMOSL3 SSM products particularly over Australia, central USA, central Asia, and the Sahel. In a second step, the AMSR-reg SSM retrievals and commonly used AMSR-E SSM retrievals derived from the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (AMSR-LPRM), were evaluated against two kinds of SSM references (i) the global MERRA-Land SSM simulations and (ii) in situ measurements over 2003-2009. The results demonstrated that both AMSR-reg and AMSR-LPRM (better when considering global simulations) successfully captured the temporal dynamics of the references used having comparable correlation values. AMSR-reg was more consistent with MERRA-land than AMSR-LPRM in terms of unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) with a global average of ubRMSE of 0.055 m(3)/m(3) for AMSR-reg and 0.084 m(3)/m(3) for AMSRLPRM. In conclusion, the statistical regression, which is tested here for the first time using long-term spaceborne TB datasets, appears to be a promising approach for retrieving SSM from passive microwave remote sensing TB observations.

The strength and extent of salinity fronts are analyzed to understand their variabilities. Salinity fronts computed from SMOS compare favorably with those computed from Argo floats data, with SMOS showing higher magnitudes and more detailed structure of the fronts than Argo. Strong salinity fronts are observed along the equatorial region, with meridional migration of the fronts following the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and meridional ocean currents. Linked with these fronts are less saline subsurface waters that are sustained by the ITCZ-influenced precipitation and warm near-surface layer. During the 2010 negative Indian Ocean Dipole event, the equatorial front was influenced more by the increased SSS along the equator rather than precipitation. Additional factors, such as advective processes, aid the dynamics of fronts in the tropical Indian Ocean. Zonal currents advect less saline waters from the eastern Indian Ocean into the central Indian Ocean. Additionally the Indonesian Throughflow transports less saline waters to the region south of the equator, which eventually influence SSS front dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This process may play an important role in reducing fieldwork costs, monitoring changes in canopy biodiversity, and locating parent trees to collect seeds for forest restoration efforts. However, mapping tree species in tropical forests with remote sensing data is a challenge because of high floristic and spectral diversity. In this research, we discriminated and mapped tree species in tropical seasonal semi-deciduous forests (Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome) by using airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral data in the 450 to 2400 nm wavelength range. After quantifying the spectral variability within and among individual tree crowns of eight species, three supervised machine learning classifiers were applied to discriminate the species at the pixel level. Linear Discriminant Analysis outperformed Support Vector Machines with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF-SVMs) kernels and Random Forests in almost all the tested cases. An average classification accuracy of 70% was obtained when using the visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 450-919 nm) bands. The inclusion of shortwave infrared bands (SWIR, 1045-2400 nm) increased the accuracy to 84%. Narrow-band vegetation indices (VIs) were also tested and increased the classification accuracy by up to 5% when combined with VNIR features. Furthermore, the spectral bands of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite sensor were simulated for classification purposes. WV-3 VNIR bands provided an accuracy of 57.4%, which increased to 74.8% when using WV-3 SWIR bands. We also tested the production of species maps by using an object-oriented approach that integrated a novel segmentation algorithm that was tailored to delineate tree crowns and label high class membership pixels inside each object. In this scenario, RBF-SVMs produced the best species maps, correctly identifying 84.9% of crowns with hyperspectral data and 78.5% with simulated WV-3 data. The use of a reduced set of hyperspectral bands, which were selected with stepwise regression, did not significantly affect the classification accuracies but allowed us to depict the most important wavelengths to discriminate the species. These wavelengths were located around the green reflectance peak (550 nm), at the red absorption feature (650 nm) and in the SWIR range at 1200,1700, 2100 and 2300 nm. These encouraging results suggest the feasibility of the proposed approach for mapping pioneering and climax tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome, highlighting its potential use in forest recovery and inventory initiatives.

Location and mapping of contaminated areas can indicate the presence of a subsurface reservoir and guide direct exploration operations in the oil industry. Superficial occurrences of hydrocarbons (HCs) can also indicate damage to pipelines. Locating small leaks can guide containment, cleaning and repair operations. Remote sensing tools for such purposes usually focus on the effects that oil in the soil causes on the spectral signatures of vegetation. Studies investigating the spectral characteristics of soil and HC mixtures are not prevalent. This study comprises the conception and analysis of a spectral library of mixtures of several mineral substrates impregnated with various concentrations of light to heavy oils (API varying from 19.4 to 41.9), using data acquired with an automated hyperspectral imaging station and processed with wavelets. The wavelet transform allowed the extraction of key spectral features and the discard of secondary information (e.g. noise and continuum), resulting in hyperspectral imagery products that proved suitable to separate different phases in the soil-HC mixture, as well as to identify the type and concentration of HC in the soil. This comprehensive spectral library and the acquired information regarding spectral characteristics of soil-hydrocarbon mixtures, opens opportunities for the development of new processing methods for the direct mapping of onshore seeps and leaks using current and future orbital hyperspectral (Hyperion; EnMap; HyspIRI) and multispectral (WordView-3) sensors.

Because highly reflective snow and ice are the main components of the cryosphere, it plays an important role in the global energy balance. Thus, any qualitative or quantitative change in the physical properties and extents of the cryosphere affects global air circulation, ocean and air temperatures, sea level, and ocean current patterns. Due to the hardships involved in collecting ground control points and field data for high alpine glaciers or vast polar ice sheets, several researchers are currently using remote sensing. Satellites provide an effective space-borne platform for remotely sensing frozen areas at the global and regional scales. However, satellite remote sensing has several constraints, such as limited spatial and temporal resolutions and expensive data acquisition. Therefore, aerial and terrestrial remote sensing platforms and sensors are needed to cover temporal and spatial gaps for comprehensive cryospheric research. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) antennas form a group of active remote sensors that can easily be deployed on all three platforms, i.e., satellite, aerial, and terrestrial. The generation of elevation data for glacial and snow-covered terrain from photogrammetry requires high contrast amongst various reflective surfaces (ice, snow, firn, and slush). Conventional passive optical remote sensors do not provide the necessary accuracy, especially due to the unavailability of reliable ground control points. However, active LiDAR sensors can fill this research gap and provide high-resolution and accurate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Due to the obvious advantages of LiDAR over conventional passive remote sensors, the number of LiDAR-based cryospheric studies has increased in recent years. In this review, we highlight studies that have utilised LiDAR sensors for the cryospheric research of various features, such as snow cover, polar ice sheets and their atmospheres, alpine glaciers, and permafrost. Because this technology shows immense promise for applications in future cryospheric research, we also emphasise the prospects of utilising LiDAR sensors. In this paper, a large compilation of relevant references is presented to allow readers to explore particular topics of interest. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous studies conducted over several decades have investigated a broad array of input data and classification methods. However, this vast assemblage of research results has not been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the relative performance of different classification processes for generating land cover products. To address this problem, we completed a statistical meta-analysis of the past 15 years of research on supervised per-pixel image classification published in five high-impact remote sensing journals. The two general factors evaluated were classification algorithms and input data manipulation as these are factors that can be controlled by analysts to improve classification accuracy. The meta-analysis revealed that inclusion of texture information yielded the greatest improvement in overall accuracy of land-cover classification with an average increase of 12.1%. This increase in accuracy can be attributed to the additional spatial context information provided by including texture. Inclusion of ancillary data, multi-angle and time images also provided significant improvement in classification overall accuracy, with 8.5%, 8.0%, and 6.9% of average improvements, respectively. In contrast, other manipulation of spectral information such as index creation (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and feature extraction (e.g. Principal Components Analysis) offered much smaller improvements in accuracy. In terms of classification algorithms, support vector machines achieved the greatest accuracy, followed by neural network methods. The random forest classifier performed considerably better than the traditional decision tree classifier. Maximum likelihood classifiers, often used as benchmarking algorithms, offered low accuracy. Our findings will help guide practitioners to decide which classification to implement and also provide direction to researchers regarding comparative studies that will further solidify our understanding of different classification processes. However, these general guidelines do not preclude an analyst from incorporating personal preferences or considering specific algorithmic benefits that may be pertinent to a particular application.

The combination of broad scale, regional climatic, and more localized, site-level drivers presents a challenge when upscaling phenology from the plot to the region. Likewise, developing relationships between ground- or camera-based estimates and satellite imagery remains difficult due to the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution. Landsat imagery, with its 16 day temporal resolution, is often thought of as being insufficient for timely observation of changes in vegetation throughout the year. However the free availability of the Landsat archive has enabled a major shift in the way Landsat imagery is processed moving towards pixel, rather than scene, based analyses. In this paper we build on previous research by examining the applicability and accuracy of Landsat derived phonology curves beyond deciduous stands into more mixed stands and conifer dominated forest types in the Rocky Mountains and foothills in Alberta, Canada. In addition, we discuss the application of these Landsat phenology curves to phenology of understorey species which are linked to habitat selection for free roaming wildlife, in particular grizzly bears. The agreement between Landsat- and camera-derived estimates of key phonological events was stronger for green up (RMSE = 7 days) than for senescence (RMSE = 14 days). Our results show that yearly adjustment of green-up and senescence dates using available Landsat observations improved the agreement with camera-derived estimates when compared to average annual curves. Seasonal phonology transition dates accepted as valid ranged from 25% for alpine herbaceous pixels to 75% for closed deciduous, demonstrating the variable success of this approach across land cover types. Season transition dates were rejected if pixels lacked a strong enough green up signal in Landsat spectral indices or if the estimated dates fell outside of the valid range. We conclude by investigating the spatial patterns of seasonal phenology at the Landsat scale, and assess the relative importance of regional vs. microsite conditions as well as the utility of these data for resource and wildlife management.

The objective of the current study was to determine if leaf area index (LAI) could be estimated accurately and consistently in five intensively managed pine plantation forests using two multiple-return airborne LiDAR datasets. Field measurements of LAI were made using the LiCOR LAI2000 and LAI2200 instruments within 116 plots were established of varying size and within a variety of stand conditions (i.e. stand age, nutrient regime and stem density) in North Carolina and Virginia in 2008 and 2013. A number of common LiDAR return height and intensity distribution metrics were calculated (e.g. average return height), in addition to ten indices, with two additional variants, utilized in the surrounding literature which have been used to estimate LAI and fractional cover, were calculated from return heights and intensity, for each plot extent. Each of the indices was assessed for correlation with each other, and was used as independent variables in linear regression analysis with field LAI as the dependent variable. All LiDAR derived metrics were also entered into a forward stepwise linear regression. The results from each of the indices varied from an R-2 of 0.33 (S.E. 0.87) to 0.89 (S.E. 0.36). Those indices calculated using ratios of all returns produced the strongest correlations, such as the Above and Below Ratio Index (ABRI) and Laser Penetration Index 1 ( LPI1). The regression model produced from a combination of three metrics did not improve correlations greatly (R-2 0.90; S.E. 0.35). The results indicate that LAI can be predicted over a range of intensively managed pine plantation forest environments accurately when using different LiDAR sensor designs. Those indices which incorporated counts of specific return numbers (e.g. first returns) or return intensity correlated poorly with field measurements. There were disparities between the number of different types of returns and intensity values when comparing the results from two LiDAR sensors, indicating that predictive models developed using such metrics are not transferable between datasets with different acquisition parameters. Each of the indices were significantly correlated with one another, with one exception (LAI proxy), in particular those indices calculated from all returns, which indicates similarities in information content for those indices. It can then be argued that LiDAR indices have reached a similar stage in development to those calculated from optical-spectral sensors, but which offer a number of advantages, such as the reduction or removal of saturation issues in areas of high biomass.

The TSLSTs were further decomposed into the seasonal and trend components by an additive model. Results showed that the overall LULC classification and change detection accuracies were 89% and 92%, respectively. Urban growth was mainly observed in Fulton County and Gwinnett County. High-intensity urban land had the largest mean 1ST value of 294.9 K and yearly amplitude of 17.4 K. A comparison of the trend component between urban and non-urban land covers showed a difference of 1.8 K per decade. Next, temporal thermal signatures were created to characterize and quantify the impact of urban LULC changes. Decomposition analysis showed that the conversion of evergreen forest to medium-intensity urban land generated the largest difference in annual LST variation (5.7 K) and the largest trend difference (0.0004 K/day).

In addition, we evaluated the MODIS nighttime and daytime land surface temperature products and the MODIS evapotranspiration product. We compared the change results by country, land cover type, and anthropogenic biome, and we also evaluated the results according to an index of human influence (HII). We found that EVI, NDVI and Tasseled Cap Greenness reveal very similar changes (r > 0.8), while there was a much lower correlation between the vegetation indices and results based on other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus, we found it informative to expand the analysis beyond the optical and near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, into the thermal regions. We found that the majority of the changes occurred in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, while Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan appeared more stable during this period. The observed changes were attributable to a combination of anthropogenic changes and weather effects. For example, changes in crop type south of the Aral Sea were revealed as increases in vegetation indices but declines in evapotranspiration, resulting from a shift from cotton to wheat. Across Kazakhstan large patches of negative vegetation changes, combined with increasing temperatures and declines in evapotranspiration were attributable to persistent droughts. Generally, we found that most browning of vegetation occurred in areas with lower human influence (except for areas with very high human influence) and most greening of the vegetation occurred in the areas with intermediate human influence. The use of multiple indicators of significant trends improved trend interpretation and attribution of proximate causes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Leaf biochemical contents (e.g., protein, cellulose and lignin) in fresh and dry leaves have been quantified from hyperspectral data using empirical models. However, they cannot be retrieved for fresh leaves by inverting radiative transfer models. We demonstrated the applicability of PROSPECT leaf optical properties model in the separation of specific absorption coefficients for protein and cellulose + lignin following a newly proposed algorithm, and evaluated the feasibility in estimating leaf protein and cellulose + lignin content through model inversion. Assessment was performed across a large variety of plant species benefiting from the Leaf Optical Properties Experiment (LOPEX) dataset. To alleviate ill-posed problems, inversion was performed over different spectral subsets. The PROSPECT model with newly calibrated specific absorption coefficients was able to accurately reconstruct leaf reflectance and transmittance. Leaf protein and cellulose + lignin were estimated at moderate to good accuracies for both fresh and dry leaves. The spectral subset of 2100-2300 nm yielded the most accurate estimation of leaf cellulose + lignin (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 5.21E-04 g/cm(2)) and protein (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 2.75E 04 g/cm(2)) in fresh leaves, which were comparable with those obtained from stepwise multiple linear regressions (protein: R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 3.91E 04 g/cm(2); cellulose + lignin: R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 2.02E 04 g/cm(2)). Our results confirm the importance of selecting a proper spectral subset that contains sufficient information for a successful inversion. For the first time, we provide promising estimations of leaf protein in fresh leaves through inversion of a radiative transfer model, which can be applied at canopy level for regional mapping if coupled with a canopy reflectance model and air- or space-borne hyperspectral imaging.

Manual mapping is a relatively slow, inefficient and potentially subjective process, particularly given the extensive spatial coverage of remotely sensed datasets. Thus, glacial geomorphic mapping would benefit from semi-automated techniques able to map large areas quickly and efficiently. Here, we develop novel semi-automated techniques for mapping glacial geomorphology, based on lidar derived data collected from Brei partial derivative amerkurjokull, Iceland using Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA). The landforms classified were moraines, eskers, flutes/drumlins, and glacio-fluvial outwash. Several land surface parameters (LSPs) were calculated during image segmentation and analysis, representing the characteristics of the landforms of interest. The segmentation and classification routines were developed in Matlab, whereas most attempts so far have used specialised OBIA software. Our techniques utilised exploratory data analysis, where statistical groupings within the data define different landform types. Accuracy was assessed against a reference map derived using traditional manual mapping techniques. Landforms were classified to an overall accuracy of 77%. Our semi-automated mapping techniques should, with further algorithm development, be applicable using other datasets commonly used in palaeo-glaciology such as radar derived elevation data and swath bathymetry.

However, most long-term NDVI datasets are based upon multiple sensor systems and unsuccessful corrections related to sensor shifts potentially introduce substantial uncertainties and artifacts in the analysis of trends. The temporal consistency of NDVI datasets should therefore be evaluated before performing trend analysis to obtain reliable results. In this study we analyze the temporal consistency of multi-sensor NDVI time series by analyzing the co-occurrence between breaks in the NDVI time series and sensor shifts from GIMMS3g (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies 3rd generation), VIP3 (Vegetation Index and Phenology version 3), LTDR4 (Long Term Data Record version 4) and SPOT-VGT (Systeme Pour l\'Observation de la Terre VEGETATION). Single sensor time series from MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra and Aqua are used as reference datasets. The global land surface is divided into six regions according to the world humidity zones and averaged NDVI time series in each region are analyzed separately using a multiple structural change detection approach. We find that artifacts exist in the VIP3 and LTDR4 NDVI datasets with an abrupt shift detected in all humidity zones coinciding with the shift from NOAA-9 to NOAA-11 in 1988 and that orbital drift effects are evident in arid regions, potentially introducing uncertainties in NDVI trend analysis. Platform/sensor change from VGT-1 to VGT-2 is found to cause a significant positive break in the SPOT-VGT NDVI time series. Potential artifacts exist in humid, dry-subhumid, semi-arid and hyper-arid regions of GIMMS3g NDVI, whereas no signs of artifacts are found in the arid region. Although temporal consistency throughout all examined datasets increases after 2000 due to the usage of advanced platforms and sensors, variations in NDVI values from 2010 to 2011 still result in different trends at global and regional scales.

Night-time METOP-A SSTs differ from drifting buoy SSTs by -0.05 K in average with a standard deviation of 0.44 K and the daytime values are respectively 0.09 K and 056 K.   Seasonal statistics have been calculated on a global regular 5-degree grid for a 6-year period to review the main biases and their characteristics. There is evidence of regional and seasonal biases, indeed the multispectral regression algorithms are known (to a various degree depending upon specific implementation) to have limitations in handling the variety of atmospheric absorption conditions encountered over the global ocean. This problem has been solved for the OSI SAP geostationary SST chain by adopting a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) profile based correction method. The same approach has been tested on a prototype chain ingesting METOP-A data and gives encouraging results. It will be used in the new polar orbiter chain under development at OSI SAF, that will process METOP-B data.

The unique spaceborne and long-wavelength SAR data currently available are L-band data, but their relationship with forest biomass is still controversial, particularly for high biomass values. While many studies assume a complete loss of sensitivity above a saturation point, typically around 100 t.ha(-1), others assume a continuous positive correlation between SAR backscatter and biomass. The objective of this paper is to revisit the relationship between L-band SAR backscatter and dense tropical forest biomass for a large range of biomass values using both theoretical and experimental approaches. Both approaches revealed that after reaching a maximum value, SAR backscatter correlates negatively with forest biomass. This phenomenon is interpreted as a signal attenuation from the forest canopy as the canopy becomes denser with increasing biomass. This result has strong implications for L-band vegetation mapping because it can lead to a greater-than-expected under-estimation of biomass. The consequences for L-band biomass mapping are illustrated, and solutions are proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The distribution of Cladophora and similar SAV in the Great Lakes and how that has changed over recent decades has been unknown, and the magnitude of the current problem relative to historic growth is difficult to assess given the lack of field data and monitoring. Here, we present the first comprehensive map of SAV in the nearshore zone of the lower four Great Lakes, where \'nearshore\' indicates the zone where the bottom reflectance is sufficient to characterize bottom substrate type, using primarily the visible bands of the Landsat TM sensor. Multiple spectral bands were combined to minimize the water-depth-dependent variance in lake bottom reflectance, and pixels were classified as dense vegetation, sparse vegetation or uncolonized substrate. Changes in vegetation cover and water clarity between the mid-1970s and present were also evaluated for several focus areas across the lakes utilizing historical Landsat TM and MSS-imagery. The Landsat-based bottom classification achieved an overall accuracy of 83% based on comparison to ground truth data. Lake-wide SAV cover ranged from 15% (Lake Huron) to 40% (Lake Ontario) of the mappable lake bottom based on detection depth. The total mapped area of vegetation corresponds to a conservative biomass estimate of 129 kilotonnes dry weight. The observed changes in the distribution of SAV over time indicate that increasing water clarity in the Lakes is expanding Cladophora habitat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Foliage clumping serves an important function in traditional indirect LAI measurement methods. The clumping index has been used to modify effective LAI for decades. However, the change in path length within canopies is often the most uncertain factor in indirect LAI estimation using Beefs law. A simple clumping index is incapable of describing the heterogeneity of a canopy and may cause large errors in calculating true LAI values. We proposed a new LAI estimation method by using path length distribution functions in optical measurement. Both simulation and field measurements show that the path length-based method can effectively characterize the LAI values of heterogeneous canopies. Deviation is less than 10% for all the validations. One of the advantages of path length distribution theory is that it can characterize and handle crown shape-induced non-randomness within canopies. Such non-randomness, which may cause underestimation of up to 25%, has not been well addressed by existing algorithms. Path length theory is expected to improve the indirect measurement accuracy of LAI significantly with the use of current optical instruments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

These geohazards have brought about severe damages to buildings, bridges and other facilities. In order to warn of and mitigate disasters, it is urgently necessary to obtain the latest rate, extent, and temporal evolution of land subsidence in Xi\'an. With multiple SAR datasets as well as leveling, GPS and ground water level of aquifers, we study and map the spatial and temporal evolution of land subsidence and ground fissures over Xi\'an. First, 62 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by Envisat, ALOS, and TerrSAR-X during 2005-2012 are used to form three independent interferometric stacks to unveil the spatial and temporal variations of land subsidence and ground fissures by using the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique. GPS and leveling measurements are applied to calibrate the InSAR results. Precision of our InSAR annual subsidence results is less than 9 mm. We derive the east-west and vertical components of the observed land deformation in 2009 using descending and ascending InSAR observations, finding out that the horizontal component of land deformation cannot be ignored if the deformation is large or ground fissures are active. Second, four main land subsidence zones are detected in Xi\'an, with an average subsidence rate of 50 mm/a during 2005-2012. Time-series InSAR results indicate that land subsidence rates in Xi\'an increased by 200% from 2005-2007 to 2008-2010, extending existing ground fissures. Third, InSAR-derived land subsidence correlates with the change in ground water level, and seasonal variations in subsidence correlate with changes in ground water pumping. Last, the consistency on the spatial-temporal distribution variation between ground fissures and land subsidence could be drawn from the time series results and profile analysis. Shapes of subsiding zones follow the general trends of mapped ground fissures and main faults in an ENE direction. Changes in the subsidence gradient are also observed over most of the ground fissures and faults. Subsidence-triggered fissures can cause localized surface displacements, aggravate localized subsidence, discontinue the integrity of ground water flow, and limit the horizontal spread of subsidence funnels. With continuing mass construction projects in Xi\'an, monitoring ground deformation with satellite InSAR therefore can provide efficient means to image land subsidence, movements of fissures and faults, and the associated geohazards.

Unfortunately, quantification of the above-ground portion of biomass using passive optical remote sensing is constrained by the complexities of mixed spectral appearance in the water land environment. Lidar remote sensing, on the other hand, has been extensively used to estimate forest biomass, and a few studies have reported their use in characterizing short or herbaceous plants. However, no empirical studies have demonstrated the combined use of lidar and spectral data to quantify above-ground biomass in herbaceous environments, including salt marshes. Thus, the findings of this study will contribute substantially to the understanding of potentials and limitations of using lidar and multi-spectral data for vegetation characterization and biomass estimates in salt marshes and other similar herbaceous environments. In this study, we evaluate the increased capability of a data fusion approach using small footprint discrete return lidar and multispectral data to quantify above-ground biomass and thus, carbon stocks in salt marshes. The specific objectives of our study were the following: 1) to understand the interaction between discrete-return airborne lidar and marsh vegetation; 2) to determine the appropriate grid size/s of lidar-derived datasets for characterizing marsh terrain and vegetation; 3) to investigate the applicability of a number of lidar metrics to predict salt marsh vegetation height and above-ground biomass; and 4) to evaluate the utility of integrating multispectral imagery with lidar to improve the predictability of regression models for quantifying above-ground biomass and carbon. Our results showed that salt marsh Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) derived using local minima in a grid spacing of 5 m x 5 m provided the best accuracy in terrain elevation estimates with an RMSE of less than 10 cm. Lidar-derived maximum vegetation heights (Lmax) provided the best agreement with field height measurements, but explained only 41% of the variance in vegetation height measurements (RMSE = 5.85 cm). Regardless of the metrics used, lidar-measured heights underestimated the field vegetation height, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies in short or herbaceous vegetation. The fusion of lidar with multispectral data improved model predictions of live, dead, and total biomass quantities. The improvement provided by the fusion over the use of lidar or multispectral data alone was marginal; the combination explained 47% of the variance, whereas the best models using lidar and multispectral data separately explained 37% and 28% of variances in live biomass measurements, respectively. However, the best biomass prediction models reported considerably low RMSEs and % root square errors (%RSEs). For example, %RSE for the biomass prediction model using lidar-derived maximum vegetation height (Lmax) was closer to 20%, which is the recommended error threshold for remote sensing based forest biomass prediction models that can be repeatedly applicable for estimating forest carbon stock change. Our findings also demonstrate that lidar as compared to spectral data can provide better estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon, even in the herbaceous and low-relief context of a salt marsh.

Despite their importance, the geographic distribution and water use of many important irrigated areas remains uncertain. This paper advances a methodology to map summer cropping irrigated areas experiencing extreme climate and different management practices in the Murray-Darling Basin (Australia). A Random Forest classification model was implemented to austral hemisphere summer irrigated areas for the water-years 2004/05 to 2010/11. The methodology used training samples from Landsat TM/ETM + reflectance data and monthly time-series of remotely-sensed observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The covariates included in the classification model characterised the monthly dynamics and rates of change of: (i) the vegetation phenology via the recurrent and persistent absorbed fractions of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR(rec), and fPAR(per), respectively); (ii) water use via remotely-sensed estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ETa), precipitation (P) and the difference between ETa and P. Observed agreement - in terms of the kappa coefficient - for correctly classified pixels in the training sample was 96%. Independent comparisons of yearly irrigated area estimates showed linear relationships with Pearson\'s correlation coefficients (r) generally greater than 0.7 for: (i) reported areas; (ii) areas with available metered water withdrawals; and (iii) estimates of agricultural yields. Sequential covariate optimisation suggested that the most important predictors to identify of irrigation areas included the emergence-senescence period (as determined by the fPAR(rec) and corresponding rates of change) and the ETa surplus over P during this period. The latter can be important when identifying supplementary irrigation due to periodically unreliable water supply in areas with otherwise high precipitation that are in-phase with summer crop growth.

The SF estimator shows very good agreement with TC in terms of error standard deviation and signal-to-noise ratio, with strong linear correlations of 0.80-0.92 but with lower error estimates. As the two estimators are not strictly comparable, their strong agreement suggests a strong complementarity between time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of errors. A better understanding of the spectral characteristics of the error is still needed to understand their differences. Next, spatial analyses of the derived (SF and TC) error maps, in terms of error standard deviation and noise-to-signal ratio, for the two satellite data are performed with principal component analysis to identify influence of vegetation/leaf-area index (LAI), rainfall, soil wetness, and spatial heterogeneity in topography and soil type on retrieval errors.

The SARA AOD was retrieved at seven resolutions (500 m, 1 km, 2 km, 4 km, 6 km, 8 km, and 10 km) using MODIS level 1 and 2 data products (MOD02, MOD03, and MOD09) for the years 2012 and 2013. For comparison purposes, the MODIS dark-target (DT) AOD observations at 10 km resolution were obtained for the same time period. Both algorithms, SARA and MODIS DT were validated using Beijing_RADI and Beijing_CAMS AERONET AOD measurements and accuracy was evaluated using the Confidence Envelope of Expected Error (CEEE). The SARA AOD achieved very high correlation (0.972-0.994) with low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE similar to 0.067-0.133) and very high accuracy (87-95%). In comparison, the MODIS DT algorithm overestimated AOD for both low and high AOD observations with large RMSE (0.115-0342) and very low accuracy (20-52%). The robustness and accuracy of SARA and the MODIS DT algorithms for low (ADD < 0.40) and high (AOD > 0.40) aerosol loadings was evaluated using the Fraction of Expected Error (FEE). The SARA algorithm achieved 46-60% higher average accuracy than the MODE DT algorithm indicating SARA\'s greater accuracy and reliability in AOD retrieval over Beijing under low and high aerosol loadings, including severe dust storms. The SARA algorithm is unique among satellite based AOD retrievals, in its ability to depict extreme dust storms (AOD similar to 5.0) at fine spatial resolution (500 m) over urban and suburban areas such as Beijing, XiangHe and the Bohai Sea, as is demonstrated by the dust storm of 17th April 2006.

A simple random sampling (SRS) estimator was used to estimate means and variances of biomass and biomass change for each measurement occasion and interval. For each year, linear regression models were used to predict mean total aboveground tree biomass for live, dead, and total biomass components from ALS-derived variables. These models predicted biomass with R-2 = 0.68, 0.59, and 0.70 and RMSEs of 32.7, 30.5, and 31.7 Mg ha(-1) for 2004, 2007 and 2009, respectively. A model assisted indirect estimator was then used to estimate biomass and biomass change for comparison to the field-based SRS estimator. This model assisted indirect approach decreased standard errors of biomass estimation relative to the SRS estimator, but had larger variances for biomass change estimation. Linear regression models were also used to directly predict field-estimated biomass change using ALS A-variables, calculated as the difference between multi-temporal ALS variables, for the study area. Integrated over the 6 year period, these change models had R-2 = 0.81, 0.72, and 0.68 with RMSEs of 2.0, 93, and 1.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for live, dead, and total aboveground tree biomass, respectively. A model assisted direct estimator reduced standard errors of change estimates by 100-200% compared to the field-based estimates. We discuss several potential advantages and limitations of the direct and indirect approaches. Our primary finding is that model assisted direct estimation of biomass change decreased estimation uncertainty relative to both field and model assisted indirect estimation.

Because forests are geographically extensive and are often remote, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is uniquely suited to monitor the state and health of forested ecosystems. However, the extent to which coarse-resolution remote sensing data can accurately capture spatial and temporal patterns of disturbance is unclear. To investigate this, we developed an 11-year time series of MODIS Normalized Burn Ratio images corresponding to peak-growing season conditions for a study area located in the Pacific Northwest of the conterminous United States. Using a temporal segmentation algorithm that was originally developed using Landsat TM and ETM data, we created annual maps of forest disturbance from these time series. We then compared these maps to a database of annual forest disturbance that was compiled using Landsat TM/ETM data for the same region. Results film this comparison revealed that about half of all pixels affected by disturbances that occupied more than 5% of a MODIS pixel were correctly identified as disturbed, including 79% of those that were affected by disturbances larger than one-third of a MODIS pixel. Our results also show that the size, severity, and timing of disturbance events, along with gridding artifacts inherent to MODIS data, interact in complex ways that influence the signature of forest disturbance events in MODIS data. These results demonstrate both the utility as well as the limitations of MODIS and other coarse spatial resolution sensors for monitoring forest disturbance at regional to global scales.

This paper proposed a generic framework (GEM) for modeling the LST dynamics in clear-sky periods. This was performed by modeling the ground-surface heat flux, which was then transformed into temperature using the surface energy balance and heat conduction equation. Three terms of fluxes were incorporated into GEM, including the nonhomogeneous term depicting the approximate upward flux, the harmonic term representing the approximate solar radiation, and the residue term involving the surplus atmosphere-related flux variations. In a single diurnal temperature cycle (DTC), we derived seven cases of the GEM, i.e., from the GEM-I to -VII, in which two to twelve controlling parameters are required. These controlling parameters are taken as unknowns in backward inversion using temporally discrete surface temperatures. Validations were performed using in-situ brightness temperatures, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) LSTs. The results show that the accuracy generally increases from GEM-I to -VII, with the mean absolute error decreasing from 1.71 to 0.33 degrees C. Particularly, GEM-II and -III can be used to normalize the four MODIS LSTs in a DTC without additional information required; and GEM-VI and -VII are useful once high accuracy is required. Further modeling also indicates that GEM is capable of interpolating LSTs under nonstandard cases with arbitrary starting time, duration length, and local latitude. We consider this study could provide practitioners more options within particular applications for modeling the temperature dynamics under diverse requirements of modeling accuracy and controlling parameter number.

Remote sensing techniques have shown potential for monitoring water quality in shallow inland lakes, especially in data-scarce areas. The purpose of this study was to determine the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d(lambda)) of the water column, in order to map the euphotic depth (Z(eu)) of Lake Naivasha, Kenya using the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). Intensive in situ radiometric and limnological data collection was undertaken at Lake Naivasha. Atmospheric correction was done on the MERIS images using MERIS Neural Network algorithms, Case 2 Waters (C2R) and Eutrophic Lakes processors and the bright pixel atmospheric correction algorithm (BPAC). The Eutrophic Lakes processor gave the most accurate atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectances at 490 nm compared to the other processors, with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 47% and a root mean square error (RMSE) 43%, with BPAC giving negative reflectances in the blue spectral range. In situ Kd and Z(eu) models were calibrated and validated using above-and under-water radiometric measurements, and tested on the Neural Network atmospheric correction processed MERIS images. The Eutrophic Lakes estimates were the most accurate, with an RMSE of 0.26 m(-1) and MAPE of 18% for K-d(490) and RMSE of 0.17 m and MAPE of 14% for Z(eu). The Z(eu) maps produced from MERIS images clearly show the variation of euphotic depth both in space and time. These results indicate the suitability of MERIS to monitor euphotic depth and other water quality parameters of shallow inland water bodies.

A consensus exists among the thermal community regarding the lack of such a kind of data, since only one operational sensor is currently providing multispectral TIR data at high spatial resolution (the case of ASTER, at 90 m spatial resolution and a 16-day revisit time). In this paper we propose a minimum multispectral configuration to allow the retrieval of both land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity (epsilon) from thermal infra-red (TIR) data. For this purpose, we propose a minimum configuration based on three TIR bands at around 8.9, 10.6 and 12.0 mu m, which allows the application of two-channel (or split-window) algorithms as well as the application of a temperature and emissivity separation (TES) method (or a combination of both) for LST retrieval.

We analysed merged microwave and infrared satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data and ocean colour phytoplankton size class biomass, primary production (PP) and new production (ExP) derived from SeaWiFS data, to assess the spatial and temporal frequency of surface thermal fronts and areas of enhanced PP and ExP. Strong and persistent surface thermal fronts occurred at the Reykjanes Ridge (RR) and sub-polar front (SPF), which sustain high PP and ExP and, outside of the spring bloom, account for 9% and 15% of the total production in the North Atlantic. When normalised by area, PP at the SPF is four times higher than the RR. Analysis of 13 years of satellite ocean colour data from SeaWiFS, and compared with MODIS-Aqua and MERIS, showed that there was no increase in Chla from 1998 to 2002, which then decreased in all areas from 2002 to 2007 and was most pronounced in the RR. These time series also illustrated that the SPF exhibited the highest PP and the lowest variation in Chia over the ocean colour record. This implies that the SPF provides a high and consistent supply of carbon to the benthos irrespective of fluctuations in the North Atlantic Oscillation.

They are typically installed on polar-orbiting satellites and cover the entire earth every 1 to 2 days. This temporal resolution is insufficient to observe oceanic processes occurring at a higher frequency, especially when taking cloud cover into account. Data from geostationary platforms can be obtained with a much better temporal resolution (images every 15 or 60 min), and thus are useful to study those processes. We show that by synergistically combining marine reflectance data from SEVIRI, a geostationary sensor, and MODIS Aqua, a polar orbiter, the resulting product is an improvement over both data sources. The synergy approach takes the reflectance from MODIS, with high quality and high spatial resolution, and modulates this over the day by the temporal variability of the SEVIRI reflectance, normalized to the SEVIRI reflectance at the time of MODIS overpass. The temporal frequency of the synergy product is much better than that of MODIS, and by using the latter\'s high quality data, the limited spatial and radiometric resolution of SEVIRI is enhanced. As the SEVIRI data is limited to a single broad red band (560-710 nm), the applications of the synergy product are limited to parameters that can be derived from this band, such as suspended particulate matter (SPM), turbidity (T) and the diffuse attenuation of photosynthetically available radiation (Kpar) in turbid waters. A geostationary ocean colour sensor over Europe will provide invaluable data concerning our marine environment. The cost of increasing the spatial resolution of a geostationary sensor is very high, and this study illustrates that a lower resolution geostationary ocean colour sensor combined with a high resolution polar orbiting sensor, can provide a high frequency synergetic product with high spatial resolution.

To date, the technology has fostered several novel approaches to characterizing avian habitat, but has been limited by the lack of detailed LiDAR-habitat attributes relevant to species across a continuum of spatial grain sizes and habitat requirements. We demonstrate a novel three-step approach for using LiDAR data to evaluate habitat based on multiple habitat attributes and accounting for their influence at multiple grain sizes using federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW; Picoides borealis) foraging habitat data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, USA First, we used high density LiDAR data (10 returns/m(2)) to predict detailed forest attributes at 20-m resolution across the entire SRS using a complementary application of nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression and multiple linear regression models. Next, we expanded on previous applications of LiDAR by constructing 95% joint prediction confidence intervals to quantify prediction error at various spatial aggregations and habitat thresholds to determine a biologically and statistically meaningful grain size. Finally, we used aggregations of 20-m cells and associated confidence interval boundaries to demonstrate a new approach to produce maps of RCW foraging habitat conditions based on the guidelines described in the species\' recovery plan. Predictive power (R-2) of regression models developed to populate raster layers ranged from 034 to 0.81, and prediction error decreased as aggregate size increased, but minimal reductions in prediction error were observed beyond 0.64-ha (4 x 4 20-m cells) aggregates. Mapping habitat quality while accounting for prediction error provided a robust method to determine the potential range of habitat conditions and specific attributes that were limiting in terms of the amount of suitable habitat. The sequential steps of our analytical approach provide a useful framework to extract detailed and reliable habitat attributes for a forest-dwelling habitat specialist, broadening the potential to apply LiDAR in conservation and management of wildlife populations.

Announced as a privately funded ocean fertilization effort to increase salmon returns, it attracted considerable press coverage, caused much public controversy and has been widely denounced by the science community. Here, we use available satellite bio-optical measurements from the MODIS/Aqua instrument and AVISO altimeter dynamic height data to examine the timing, magnitude and extent of this artificial iron fertilization experiment, comparing it with natural fertilization events such as volcanic ash deposition and mesascale eddy transport in the Gulf of Alaska. With respect to other Haida eddies over the past 10 years, this event produced the highest chlorophyll concentrations observed late (>400 days) in eddy life history, produced the strongest bloom ever observed in an eddy in late-summer and induced this late-summer bloom earlier in the season than any other eddy. With respect to the local area of the fertilization, this experiment induced the most intensive phytoplanlcton bloom of the past 10 years, similar to 2x stronger than that caused by Kasatochi volcano in 2008, similar to 5 x that typically observed in the region, including any induced by passing eddies of previous years. Due to its limited spatial and temporal scales, however, estimated total annual carbon drawdown over the Gulf of Alaska by this experiment is one order of magnitude smaller than the Kasatochi volcano and mesoscale Haida eddies. The target eddy followed a path typical of previous Haida eddies, but with relatively weak dynamic height and rotational circulation. Satellite-based calculations also suggest that only a small fraction of the dumped iron might have been taken up by phytoplankton. The extent to which this localized experiment may impact higher trophic levels such as salmon remains uncertain. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It is further a fundamental parameter in land surface processes and Earth system climate models. Remote sensing methods offer an opportunity to improve on each of these requirements but are typically limited by the necessity for validation using labor intensive and sparsely collected in situ measurements.   In this paper we present the results of an intercomparative study of ground-based, airborne and spaceborne retrievals of total LAI over the conifer-dominated forests of Sierra Nevada in California. The efficacy of LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor) airborne waveform lidar LAI measurements (total and vertical profile) has previously been validated at the site specific level using destructive sampling. We also explore the efficacy of ground based measurements obtained from hemispherical photography, LAI-2000, and ground based lidar, acknowledging discrepancies existing between the systems and collected data. We highlight their use and role in validating the relationship between ground and airborne estimates of total LAI (LVIS LAI correlation with i) hemispherical photographs, r(2) = 0.80, ii) IAI-2000, r(2) = 0.85, and iii) terrestrial lidar, r(2) = 0.76. The existence of such relationships offers immediate implications for LAI estimation where LVIS data is available, creating the potential to obtain, not only total LAI values but also corresponding vertical LAI distributions from a ground validated source previously unobtainable at this spatial scale.   The ability to validate airborne lidar LAI data collected at different spatial scales to the available ground measurements allows further upscaled validation using global lidar datasets provided by spacebome lidar, such as the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). In the absence of adequate ground validation plots coincident with GLAS footprints, GLAS LAI validation is examined using geographically limited but spatially continuous LVIS data. Under favorable conditions, significantly the absence of slopes greater than similar to 20 degrees, the comparison between LVIS and GLAS IAI values obtained using a recursive algorithm constrained by independently validated LAI limits exposes the capability of GLAS as an accurate standalone LAI sensor (r(2) = 0.69, bias = -0.05 and RMSE = 0.33). The correlation comparison between LVIS and GLAS LAI estimates not only significantly exceed those associated with equivalent space borne passive remote sensing datasets, such as MODIS (r(2) = 0.20, bias = -0.16 and RMSE = 0.67) but also offers significant advantages to future research including the prospective validation of regional and global L.Al products and data comparison with ecosystem model inputs. The encountered effectiveness of these relationships allows the implementation of a scaling-up strategy where ground-based LAI observations are related to aircraft observations of LAI, which in turn are used to validate GLAS LAI derived from coincident data. Successful implementation of this strategy paves the way for the future recovery of vertical LAI profiles on a global scale and opens up the potential for fusion studies to incorporate widely available and spatially abundant passive optical datasets.

This study aims to quantify the impact of soil moisture on vegetation at large spatial and long-term temporal scales using independent satellite observations. We used a newly developed satellite-derived soil moisture product and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the impact of soil moisture on vegetation across mainland Australia between 1991 and 2009. Our approach relied on multiple statistical methods including: (i) windowed cross correlation; (ii) quantile regression: (iii) piecewise linear regression. We found a strong positive relationship between soil moisture and NDVI, with NDVI typically lagging behind soil moisture by one month. The temporal characteristics of this relation show substantial regional variability. Dry regions with low vegetation density are more sensitive to soil moisture for the high end of the distribution of NDVI than moist regions, suggesting that soil moisture enhances vegetation growth in dry regions and in the early stage in wet regions. Using piecewise linear regression, we detected three periods with different soil moisture trends over the 19 years. The changes in NDVI trends are significant (p < 0.01) with turning points of soil moisture in the beginning of 2000 and the end of 2002. Our findings illustrate the usefulness of the new soil moisture product by demonstrating the impacts of soil moisture on vegetation at various temporal scales. This analysis could be used as a benchmark for coupled vegetation climate models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.', '[Chen, T.; de Jeu, R. A. M.; van der Werf, G. R.; Dolman, A.

The development of temporally consistent land cover time series (LCTS) from satellite-based earth observation has proven difficult because multi-year observations are acquired under different conditions resulting in high inter-annual reflectance variability. This leads to spurious differences in land cover when standard approaches for image classification are applied to generate multi-year land cover data. To reduce this effect, a common solution has been to first detect change and update a base map for only these change areas. As long as the change commission error is low, this approach will ensure high consistency between maps in the time series. Here we present an approach for change-based LCTS development following from previous research, but with significant advancements in change detection, training, classification, and evidence-based refinement. The method was applied to generate an annual LCTS covering Canada spanning 2000-2011 that is consistent between years and can be used to identify dominant change transitions. Assessment of the LCTS was challenging because multiple maps needed to be evaluated and can be prohibitive particularly for annual time series covering several years. Three approaches were undertaken involving visual examination, comparison with a reference sample derived from Landsat, and comparison with the MODIS Global LCTS V5.1. Visual assessment revealed high inter-map consistency and logical temporal change trajectories of land cover classes. Comparison with the reference sample showed an accuracy of 70% at the 19 class thematic resolution. Accounting for mixed pixels by considering the first or second reference land cover label as correct increased the accuracy to 80%. Comparison with the MODIS Global LCTS showed that the Canada LCTS achieved higher inter-map consistency and accuracy as expected with national relative to global land cover products.

The V5 LSTs are underestimated by more than 2 K and up to 4.5 K at the desert site near In-salah, Algeria. Three refinements were implemented in the V6.3.0 daily LST Product Generation Executive (PGE)16 code: 1) refine the original viewing angle dependent split-window algorithm by adding two sets of coefficients separately for retrieval of daytime and nighttime LSTs at bare soil pixels in the hot and warm bare soil zone (HAWBSZ) within latitude range from -38 degrees to 49.5 degrees, 2) adjust the emissivity difference in bands 31 and 32 for bare soil pixels in HAWBSZ, and 3) incorporate the new refined split-window algorithm into the day/night algorithm for retrieving surface emissivity and temperature values at 6 km grids in HAWBSZ. The V63.0 PGE16 code was tested with C6 Aqua and Terra MODIS input data over a period of one year or longer in selected tile regions. The resulting C6 level-2 LST products were evaluated at five bare soil sites in north Africa, where radiosonde observation data for atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles are available, with 12 R-based validation data sets as follows: the mean LST error is within +/-0.6 K in 10 validate data sets, 0.8 K in one data set (for daytime LSTs at SVU site) and 1.9 K in another set (for daytime LSTs at Farafra site). The standard deviation of the C6 LST validation errors is less than 0.5 K in all the 12 validation data sets but the data set for daytime LSTs at Farafra site at 0.7 K. Statistical and viewing angle dependence analyses of the retrieved surface emissivity values also indicate that the C6 level-3 LST products are much better than the previous C4.1 and C5 products.

Taking into consideration accuracy issues with in situ observations, results show that utilizing all high-quality, cloud-free MODIS retrievals gives physically realistic ice sheet albedo values for solar zenith angles less than 75, with a root-mean-square error of 0.067 (RMSE) and an overall mean bias of +0.022 (with the MODIS data biased slightly high relative to the in situ data). Using this data set, changes in ice sheet albedo from 2000 to 2012 are documented. Analysis reveals negative trends in ice sheet albedo during summer over the 13-year data record, with persistent negative albedo anomalies in recent years over western Greenland. During summer 2012, extensive surface melt resulted in a Greenland area-averaged albedo anomaly for June, July August relative to 2000-2009 of -0.044 that significantly increased the amount of total absorbed solar radiation and surface melt.

Satellite remote sensing has the potential for extracting continuous information related to C exchange rates at regional and global extents, yet, few studies have focused on peatlands. In this study we examined the potential of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI and simple ratio, SR), MODIS light use efficiency (LUE) based gross primary production (GPP) and a MODIS derived phenological index (annual peak photosynthetic rate) for the estimation of eddy covariance (EC) flux-derived GPP and net ecosystem production (NEP) at four contrasting northern peatlands. At the four sites of this study MODIS NDVI and SR explained between 39% and 71%, and between 42% and 69% of the variation in EC-derived GPP, respectively; and between 25% and 53%, and between 29% and 39% of the variation in EC-derived NEP, respectively. The relationships were mostly consistent across sites and within sites, suggesting that data may be pooled across years and sites, which could simplify the prediction of gross and net C dioxide (CO2) uptake over large areas dominated by northern peatlands based on MODIS data. MODIS GPP explained between 68% and 89% of the variation in EC-derived GPP at the four study sites. The root mean square errors ranged between 0.62 and 1.16 g C m(-2) d(-1) and were similar to errors from ecosystem process model estimates reported in the literature. Annual peak MODIS GPP, NDVI and SR rates explained up to 50% of the variations in annual cumulative EC-derived GPP and NEP at two of the study sites. Our results show the potentials and limitations of MODIS data to monitor the C dynamics of northern peatlands; among the three studied approaches the MODIS LUE-based GPP approach showed better performance as a predictor of GPP and NEP. The other approaches (VIs and phenology) can provide important input data for LUE models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Urban environmental studies, however, still lack methods to characterize urban vegetation with adequate detail and across large areas. To remedy this gap, we apply a Support-Vector-Machine approach to classify eight frequent tree genera in the capital city of Berlin, Germany. We investigate different spectral and temporal band combinations of five RapidEye images acquired during the 2009 phenological season, and use ancillary surface and terrain models for orthorectification and improved tree masking. Results show that intra-annual time-series of RapidEye data can be used for high-precision tree genera classification in an urban environment. Differences within RapidEye time-series correlate well with empirical phenological studies of different tree genera, and RapidEye\'s red-edge band supports class separability. Further assessment is needed on the individual tree level and mixed stands regarding the quality of mapping urban individual trees, as our sampling approach mainly focused on larger stands with only a single tree genus. Urban applications will benefit from multitemporal RapidEye data, which offers area-wide monitoring and allows in-depth vegetation analysis to augment existing assessments. Such information is indispensable for assessing differences in urban ecosystem services related to carbon storage, cooling or air filtering, all of which differ between tree species. Therefore, the importance of in-depth analyses of urban vegetation cannot be underestimated in today\'s context of climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

For instance, the vertical distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) affects vegetation growth, informative upon carbon and energy cycling. Availing upon advances in information capture and computing power, geometrically explicit modeling of forest structure becomes increasingly possible: A primary challenge however is acquiring the forest mensuration data required to parameterize these models and the related automation of modeling forest structure. In this research, to address these issues we employ a novel and automated approach that capitalizes upon the rich information afforded by ground-based laser scanning technology. The method is implemented in two steps: in the first step, geometric explicit models of canopy structure are created from the ground-based laser scanning data. These geometric explicit models are used to simulate the vertical range to first hit. In the second step, we derive canopy gap probability from full waveform laser scanning data which have been used in a number of studies for characterization of radiation transmission Uupp et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010) and do not require any geometric explicit modeling. The radiative consistency of the geometric explicit models from step 1 is validated against the gap probabilities of step 2. The results show a strong relationship between the radiative transmission properties of the geometric models and canopy gap probabilities at plot level (R = 0.91 to 0.97), while the geometric models suggest the additional benefit to serve as a bridge in scaling between shoot level and canopy level radiation.

In a Douglas-fir forest in Corvallis, Oregon, PRI varied primarily with illumination, which was strongly influenced by canopy aspect and time of day. Once normalized for illumination, PRI exhibited a pattern of midday depression similar to that of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. Comparable optical responses to illumination were detected at canopy and leaf scales, demonstrating that remote spectroradiometry could be applied to monitor photosynthetic downregulation in uniform, closed stands. In similar measurements at a ponderosa pine forest in Black Butte, Oregon, an old tree exhibited more suppressed midday PRI values than a young tree, once values were normalized for illumination. Unlike the PRI response in Douglas-fir, variation in the diurnal PRI response between individual ponderosa pine trees was a predominant source of PRI variation. This contrasting age effect was consistent with other studies at this site showing reduced midday photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in old trees due to hydraulic limitations. These results indicate that diurnal and spatial patterns of photosynthetic activity in structurally complex evergreen forest stands can be characterized with narrow-band spectral reflectance, provided measurements are properly normalized by illumination. These findings also support recent studies using field and satellite remote sensing that report strong effects of illumination on the PRI signal from forest stands, and provide additional evidence that individual canopy responses can reveal contrasting degrees of photosynthetic downregulation due to varying stress effects within a single forest stand. Together, these results support the hypothesis that photosynthesis is coordinately regulated, allowing PRI to detect changing levels of stomatal activity and carboxylation. While illumination patterns and photosynthetic downregulation both influenced PRI, pigment pool sizes and enhanced PRI under prolonged low light provided additional sources of PRI variation in the canopy signal. Further understanding of these multiple PRI responses could help realize the goal of remote sensing of photosynthetic activity using PRI. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Cropping intensity, the number of crops planted annually, can be used as a measure of food security for smallholder farmers given that it can greatly affect net production. Current techniques for quantifying cropping intensity may not accurately map smallholder farms where the size of one field is typically smaller than the spatial resolution of readily available satellite data. We evaluated four methods that use multi-scalar datasets and are commonly used in the literature to assess cropping intensity of smallholder farms: 1) the Landsat threshold method, which identifies if a Landsat pixel is cropped or uncropped during each growing season, 2) the MODIS peak method, which determines if there is a phenological peak in the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index time series during each growing season, 3) the MODIS temporal mixture analysis, which quantifies the sub-pixel heterogeneity of cropping intensity using phenological MODIS data, and 4) the MODIS hierarchical training method, which quantifies the sub-pixel heterogeneity of cropping intensity using hierarchical training techniques. Each method was assessed using four criteria: 1) data availability, 2) accuracy across different spatial scales (at aggregate scales 250 x 250 m, 1 x 1 km, 5 x 5 km, and 10 x 10 km), 3) ease of implementation, and 4) ability to use the method over large spatial and temporal scales. We applied our methods to two regions in India (Gujarat and southeastern Madhya Pradesh) that represented diversity in crop type, soils, climatology, irrigation access, cropping intensity, and field size. We found that the Landsat threshold method is the most accurate (R-2 >= 0.71 and RMSE <= 0.14), particularly at smaller scales of analysis. Yet given the limited availability of Landsat data, we find that the MODIS hierarchical training method meets multiple criteria for mapping cropping intensity over large spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, the adjusted R-2 between predicted and validation data generally increased and the RMSE decreased with spatial aggregation >= 5 x 5 km (R-2 up to 0.97 and RMSE as low as 0.00). Our model accuracy varied based on the region and season of analysis and was lowest during the summer season in Gujarat when there was high sub-pixel heterogeneity due to sparsely cropped agricultural land-cover. While our results specifically apply to our study regions in India, they most likely also apply to smallholder agriculture in other locations across the globe where the same types of satellite data are readily available.

When implementing SMA, endmember selection is considered an important step, and an inappropriate endmember set could severely affect the accuracy of fractional land covers. Although different degrees of success have been achieved in existing SMA approaches, the paradox of endmember selection is still unsolved: theoretically \"purest\" endmembers that can be selected with relative ease do not always yield optimal results, while the selection of the most \"representative\" endmembers is very difficult with simple SMA. To address this problem, we propose a spatially adaptive SMA (SASMA) technique to automatically extract and synthesize the \"most representative\" endmembers for SMA through considering both between-class and within-class variations. In particular, we developed a classification tree method to automatically extract endmember candidates through incorporating spectral and spatial information. In addition, to mitigate the effect of within-class variation, we employed synthetic spectra of neighboring endmember candidates in a local search window as the most \"representative\" endmember signature. Results indicate that SASMA performs well in estimating subpixel impervious surface distribution with relatively high precision (mean absolute error of 8.50%, root mean square error of 15.25%, and R-2 of 0.701) and small bias (systematic error of -0.93%).

Previous studies demonstrated the retrieval of F-s on a global scale using high spectral resolution measurements by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) on board the greenhouse gases observing satellite (GOSAT). The retrieval of F-s from GOSAT-FTS data is based on the modeling of the in-filling of solar Fraunhofer lines by F-s. The first Fs retrieval methods for GOSAT-FTS measurements were based on physical formulations of the radiative transfer between the atmosphere, the surface and the instrument including the F-s emission. As an alternative, a statistical method was also successfully applied to GOSAT data. This method is based on a singular vector decomposition (SVD) technique producing a basis of spectral functions able to model the contribution of the reflected solar radiation to the top-of-atmosphere measurement in a linear way. The F-s signal is included in the forward model as an extra parameter adding to the reflected solar radiation. Here, we use field spectroscopy measurements to provide further experimental evidence on the retrieval of F-s with statistical approaches in both Fraunhofer lines and atmospheric oxygen and water vapor bands. The statistical retrieval method used with GOSAT-FTS data has been adapted to a set of ground-based spectro-radiometer measurements in the 717-780 nm range. Retrieval results in the 745-759 nm window, which contains only Fraunhofer lines, support the overall approach of estimating F-s from space measurements in that spectral window. Furthermore, the application of the method to broader fitting windows including both Fraunhofer lines and and (oxygen and water vapor) atmospheric bands atmospheric bands has been proven to be very effective to reduce the retrieval noise and has also shown a good comparison with reference O(2)A-based retrievals. This allows consideration of statistical methods as a powerful option for F-s retrieval from broad-band space-based measurements in the near-infrared.

Passive microwave sensing of the river and floodplain at more than twenty locations upstream of Hardinge Bridge (Ganges) and Bahadurabad (Brahmaputra) gauging stations are used to: 1) examine the capability of remotely sensed flow information to track the downstream propagation of river flow waves and 2) evaluate their use in producing river flow nowcasts, and forecasts at 1-15 days lead time. The pattern of correlation between upstream satellite data and in situ observations of downstream discharge is used to estimate wave propagation time. This pattern of correlation is combined with a cross-validation method to select the satellite sites that produce the most accurate river discharge estimates in a lagged regression model. The results show that the well-correlated satellite-derived flow (SDF) signals were able to detect the propagation of a river flow wave along both river channels. The daily river discharge (contemporaneous) nowcast produced from the upstream SDFs could be used to provide missing data estimates given its Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.8 for both rivers; and forecasts have considerably better skill than autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model beyond 3-day lead time for Brahmaputra. Due to the expected better accuracy of the SDF for detecting large flows, the forecast error is found to be lower for high flows compared to low flows. Overall, we conclude that satellite-based flow estimates are a useful source of dynamical surface water information in data-scarce regions and that they could be used for model calibration and data assimilation purposes in near-time hydrologic forecast applications.

MOD17A2 estimates GPP according to the light use efficiency (LUE) concept assuming a fixed maximum rate of carbon assimilation per unit photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the vegetation (epsilon(max)). Minimum temperature and vapor pressure deficit derived from meteorological data down-regulate epsilon(max) and constrain carbon assimilation. This data is useful for regional to global studies of the terrestrial carbon budget, climate change and natural resources. In this study we evaluated the MOD17A2 product and its driver data by using in situ measurements of meteorology and eddy covariance GPP for 12 African sites. MOD17A2 agreed well with eddy covariance GPP for wet sites. Overall, seasonality was well captured but MOD17A2 GPP was underestimated for the dry sites located in the Sahel region. Replacing the meteorological driver data derived from coarse resolution reanalysis data with tower measurements reduced MOD17A2 GPP uncertainties, however, the underestimations at the dry sites persisted. Inferred epsilon(max) calculated from tower data was higher than the epsilon(max) prescribed in MOD17A2. This, in addition to uncertainties in fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) explains some of the underestimations. The results suggest that improved quality of driver data, but primarily a readjustment of the parameters in the biome parameter look-up table (BPLUT) may be needed to better estimate GPP for African ecosystems in MOD17A2.

This study develops an automatic method in processing IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) altimeter L1B data (one elevation per 3-4 m horizontally) to derive a local sea level height for referencing snow freeboards and then computing sea ice thicknesses. Four 30-km LIB profiles (A, B, C and D) flown on October 21, 2009 over the Bellingshausen Sea in Antarctica are selected. The local sea level reference is first obtained by visual examination of ATM L1B heights over leads or thin ice identified on images simultaneously acquired from the Digital Mapping System camera (called manual selection). This sea level reference is then used as ground truth to validate sea level heights derived by automatic calculations using five thresholds of 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.2% and 0.1% of the lowest LIB data. The L1B_02% method gives a similar sea level height as from the LIB manual selection, by mean (absolute) difference of -0.01 (0.06) m. The sea level heights demonstrate a near linear gradient of 0.01 m/km to 0.03 m/km within each similar to 30-km L1B profile along the flight track from section A to D. The resulting mean snow freeboards are 0.59 m, 0.67 m, 053 m, and 0.60 m on sections A, B, C and D, respectively. Three empirical equations and the buoyancy equation (with zero ice freeboard assumption) all give similar statistics in ice thickness estimation with mean ice thicknesses of 1.91 m for section A, 2.16 m for B, 1.76 m for C, and 1.94 m for D. The sea level over leads cannot be accurately resolved from the ATM L2 data (similar to 60 m x 80 m horizontal averaging). However, by using a sea level reference obtained from the LIB data, the ATM L2 data can achieve reasonable ice thickness estimates with mean absolute difference of only 0.10 m compared to thickness derived from the L1B data.

Increases in burned area and fire severity are not only releasing more carbon to the atmosphere, but likely shifting vegetation composition in the region towards greater deciduous dominance and a reduction in coniferous stands. While some recent studies have addressed qualitative differences between large and small fire years in the Alaskan boreal forest, the ecological effects of a greater proportion of burning occurring during large fire years and during late season fires have not yet been examined.   Some characteristics of wildfires that can be detected remotely are related to fire severity and can provide new information on spatial and temporal patterns of burning. This analysis focused on boreal wildfire intensity (fire radiative power, or FRP) contained in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily active fire product from 2003 to 2010. We found that differences in FRP resulted from seasonality and intra-annual variability in fire activity levels, vegetation composition, latitudinal variation, and fire spread behavior.   Our studies determined two general categories of active fire detections: new detections associated with the spread of the fire front and residual pixels in areas that had already experienced front burning. Residual pixels had a lower average FRP than front pixels, but represented a high percentage of all pixels during periods of high fire activity (large fire years, late season burning, and seasonal periods of high fire activity). As a result, the FRP from periods of high fire activity was less intense than those from periods of low fire activity. Differences related to latitude were greater than expected, with higher latitudes burning later in the season and at a higher intensity than lower latitudes. Differences in vegetation type indicate that coniferous vegetation is the most fire prone, but deciduous vegetation is not particularly fire resistant, as the proportion of active fire detections in deciduous stands is roughly the same as the fraction of deciduous vegetation in the region.   Qualitative differences between periods of high and low fire activity are likely to reflect important differences in fire severity. Large fire years are likely to be more severe, characterized by more late season fires and a greater proportion of residual burning. Given the potential for severe fires to effect changes in vegetation cover, the shift toward a greater proportion of area burning during large fire years may influence vegetation patterns in the region over the medium to long term.

Spectral feature analysis compared the AVIRIS data to reference spectra of oiled marsh by using absorption features centered near 1.7 and 23 mu m, which arise from C-H bonds in oil. AVIRIS-derived maps of oiled shorelines from the individual dates of July 31, September 14, and October 4, 2010, were 89.3%, 89.8%, and 90.6% accurate, respectively. A composite map at 3.5 m grid spacing, accumulated from the three dates, was 93.4% accurate in detecting oiled shorelines. The composite map had 100% accuracy for detecting damaged plant canopy in oiled areas that extended more than 1.2 m into the marsh. Spatial resampling of the AVIRIS data to 30 m reduced the accuracy to 73.6% overall. However, detection accuracy remained high for oiled canopies that extended more than 4 m into the marsh (23 of 28 field reference points with oil were detected). Spectral resampling of the 3.5 m AVIRIS data to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) spectral response greatly reduced the detection of oil spectral signatures. With spatial resampling of simulated Landsat ETM data to 30 m, oil signatures were not detected. Overall, similar to 40 km of coastline, marsh comprised mainly of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, were found to be oiled in narrow zones at the shorelines. Zones of oiled canopies reached on average 11 m into the marsh, with a maximum reach of 21 m. The field and airborne data showed that, in many areas, weathered oil persisted in the marsh from the first field survey. July 10, to the latest airborne survey. October 4, 2010.

Terrestrially bound surveys are labor intensive and are generally limited to a small spatial extent, and while existing satellite data cover the whole world, they are limited to coarse resolution. This paper describes the production of a high resolution (1 m) mosaic image of the city of Berlin, Germany at night. The dataset is spatially analyzed to identify the major sources of light pollution in the city based on urban land use data. An area-independent \'brightness factor\' is introduced that allows direct comparison of the light emission from differently sized land use classes. and the percentage area with values above average brightness is calculated for each class. Using this methodology, lighting associated with streets has been found to be the dominant source of zenith directed light pollution (31.6%), although other land use classes have much higher average brightness. These results are compared with other urban light pollution quantification studies. The minimum resolution required for an analysis of this type is found to be near 10 m. Future applications of high resolution datasets such as this one could include: studies of the efficacy of light pollution mitigation measures, improved light pollution simulations, economic and energy use, the relationship between artificial light and ecological parameters (e.g. circadian rhythm, fitness, mate selection, species distributions, migration barriers and seasonal behavior), or the management of nightscapes.

The Canadian National Forest Inventory program has derived a limited set of attributes from a Landsat-based land cover product representing circa year 2000 conditions. Of the required inventory attributes, forest vertical structure (e.g., tree height) is critical for terrestrial biomass and carbon modeling and to date, is unavailable for these remote areas. In this study, we develop a large-area, fine-scale (25 m) mapping solution to estimate tree height (mean, dominant, and Lorey\'s height) across Canada\'s northern forests by integrating lidar data (representing 0.27% of the study area), and Landsat imagery (representing 100% of the study area), using a geometric-optical modeling technique. First, spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was used to extract image endmembers and generate fraction images. Second, lidar data were used to calibrate the inverted geometric-optical model by adjusting the model\'s three key fractional inputs: sunlit crown, sunlit background, and shade fraction, based upon the SMA derived images. The heterogeneity of the study area, spanning 2.16 million ha, made it challenging to directly and accurately decompose mixed Landsat image pixels into the canopy and background fractions used for the Li-Strahler geometric-optical model inversion. As a result we developed a novel method to use the lidar plot data to facilitate the calculation of these fractions in an accurate and automated manner. The average estimation errors for mean, dominant, and Lorey\'s height were 4.9 m, 4.1 m, and 4.7 m, respectively when compared to the lidar data, with the best result achieved using dominant tree height, where the average error was 3.5 m for over 80% of the forested area. Using this approach of optical remotely sensed data calibrated and validated with lidar height estimates, we generate and evaluate wall-to-wall estimates of tree height that can subsequently be used as inputs for biomass and carbon modeling.

Results indicate a decline in the overall flaring activity during the time period considered in this work, although single sites can show positive flaring trends. The ATSR derived flaring time series has been compared to the crude oil production data provided by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), showing very good agreement in terms of trend and seasonal behaviour. We present a simple inversion scheme aimed at the evaluation of the flame parameters (temperature and size) from night-time shortwave, middle and thermal infrared ATSR measurements, and results are discussed in detail. Finally, the possibility to estimate flaring efficiency from satellite measurements and from detailed technical information on flaring devices is envisaged. The proposed approach can be easily extended to other areas in which gas flaring from off-shore oil and gas extraction are an important economic and environmental factor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This study explores the complementarity of India\'s ResourceSat-1 Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) with the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). The analysis focuses on the comparative radiometry, geometry, and spectral properties of the two sensors. Two applied assessments of these data are also explored to examine the strengths and limitations of these alternate sources of moderate resolution land imagery with specific application domains. There are significant technical differences in these imaging systems including spectral band response, pixel dimensions, swath width, and radiometric resolution which produce differences in observation data sets. None of these differences was found to strongly limit comparable analyses in agricultural and forestry applications. Overall, we found that the AWiFS and Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery are comparable and in some ways complementary, particularly with respect to temporal repeat frequency. We have found that there are limits to our understanding of the AWiFS performance, for example, multi-camera design and stability of radiometric calibration over time, that leave some uncertainty that has been better addressed for Landsat through the Image Assessment System and related cross-sensor calibration studies. Such work still needs to be undertaken for AWiFS and similar observatories that may play roles in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems Land Surface Imaging Constellation.

Mapping the spread of biological invasions is a necessary first step toward understanding the factors determining invasion patterns. Urban areas may function as propagule sources for glossy privet because it has been used as a landscaping tree for over a century. The objectives of this paper were to 1) map the patterns of glossy privet expansion from 1983 to 2006 using a time series of Landsat TM/ETM + images, and 2) analyze the spatial pattern of glossy privet stands with regard to urban extent. Using six summer Landsat TM images (1983, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2001, and 2006) the expansion of glossy privet was analyzed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a non-parametric classifier which we applied to a stack of all images simultaneously, a novel approach in its application to monitor non-native tree invasions. We then measured the area of glossy privet in a series of 200-m buffers at increasing distances around urban areas in 1983 and 2006, and compared it with the amount of privet expected in proportion to buffer area Glossy privet in the study area has spread very rapidly during the 23 years that we studied and the SVM resulted in highly accurate classifications (Kappa Index 0.88, commission error 0.07, omission error 0.16). Between 1983 and 2006 glossy privet area increased 50 times (from 50 to 2500 ha), and 20% of all forest in the study area is now dominated by glossy privet Most of the glossy privet dominated stands were located within 600 m of urban areas. However, the rate of glossy privet expansion accelerated substantially after 1992 and new glossy privet dominated stands tend to be located away from urban areas. This suggests that glossy privet is now self-sustaining, but expected urban growth in the area could further foster glossy privet invasion. Management and development plans should include mitigation efforts to contain this species and prevent invasion into native forests, and citizens should be informed about the risk of invasion associated with the use of glossy privet for landscaping.

By using the HOTSAT satellite thermal monitoring system to estimate time-varying TADR (time averaged discharge rate) and the MAGFLOW physics-based model to simulate lava flow paths, the LAV@HAZARD platform allows timely definition of parameters and maps essential for hazard assessment, including the propagation time of lava flows and the maximum run-out distance. We used LAV@HAZARD during the 2008-2009 lava flow-forming eruption at Mt Etna (Sicily, Italy). We measured the temporal variation in thermal emission (up to four times per hour) during the entire duration of the eruption using SEVIRI and MODIS data. The time-series of radiative power allowed us to identify six diverse thermal phases each related to different dynamic volcanic processes and associated with different TADRs and lava flow emplacement conditions. Satellite-derived estimates of lava discharge rates were computed and integrated for the whole period of the eruption (almost 14 months), showing that a lava volume of between 32 and 61 million cubic meters was erupted of which about 2/3 was emplaced during the first 4 months. These time-varying discharge rates were then used to drive MAGFLOW simulations to chart the spread of lava as a function of time. TADRs were sufficiently low (<30 m(3)/s) that no lava flows were capable of flowing any great distance so that they did not pose a hazard to vulnerable (agricultural and urban) areas on the flanks of Etna.

A regression tree-based model (Random Forest) produces good results (cross-validated R-2 0.81, RMSE 13 T/ha) when trained with a sufficient number of field plots representative of the vegetation variability at national scale. The Random Forest model captures non-linear relationships between satellite data and biomass density, and is able to use categorical data (land cover) in the regression to improve the results. Biomass estimates were strongly correlated (r = 0.90 and r = 0.83) with independent LiDAR measurements. In this study, we demonstrate that in certain contexts Landsat data provide the capability to spatialize field biomass measurements and produce accurate and detailed estimates of biomass distribution at national scale. We also investigate limitations of this approach, which tend to provide conservative biomass estimates. Specific limitations are mainly related to saturation of the optical signal at high biomass density and cloud cover, which hinders the compilation of a radiometrically consistent multi-temporal dataset As a result, a Landsat mosaic created for Uganda with images acquired in the dry season during 1999-2003 does not contain phenological information useful for discriminating some vegetation types, such as deciduous formations. The addition of land cover data increases the model performance because it provides information on vegetation phenology. We note that Landsat data present higher spatial and thematic resolution compared to land cover and allow detailed and spatially continuous biomass estimates to be mapped. Fusion of satellite and ancillary data may improve biomass predictions but, to avoid error propagation, accurate, detailed and up-to-date land cover or other ancillary data are necessary.

Since uncertainties in SWCLR can propagate into errors in DRE or DCF, we assess the SWCLR estimates over the global oceans using three approaches and quantify the differences among these methods both as a function of space and season. Our results indicate that the more commonly used intercept (73.4 +/- 3.6) and radiative transfer methods (74.7 +/- 4.0 Wm(-2)) are in close agreement to within +/- 1.3 Wm(-2). Values of SWCLR are provided as a function of space and season that can be used by other studies that require such values or as a source of validation.

A general problem in the validation of operationally produced global biophysical vegetation products is the lack of ground reference data on the seasonal variability of different land surface types. Currently, little is known about the spectral properties of the understory layers of boreal forests, and even less is known about the seasonal dynamics of the spectra. In this paper, we report seasonal trajectories of understory reflectance spectra measured in a European boreal forest. Four study sites representing different forest fertility site types were selected from central Finland. The understory composition was recorded and its spectra measured with an ASD FieldSpec Hand-Held UV/VNIR Spectroradiometer ten times during the growing period (from May to September) in 2010. Our results show that the spectral differences between and within understory types are the largest at the peak of the growing season in early July whereas in the beginning and end of the growing season (i.e. early May and late September, respectively) the differences between the understory types are marginal. In general, the fertile sites had the brightest NIR spectra throughout the growing season whereas infertile types appeared darker in NIR. Our results also indicated that a mismatch in the seasonal development of understory and tree layers does not occur in boreal forests: the understory and tree layer vegetation develop at a similar pace in the spring (i.e. there are no or only few spring ephemerals present), and the forests with the strongest seasonal dynamics in tree canopy structure (LAI) have also the strongest dynamics in understory spectra.

The measurement requirements of these different goals will require compromises in sensor design. Footprint diameters that would be larger than optimal for vegetation studies have been proposed. Some spaceborne lidar mission designs include the possibility that a lidar sensor would share a platform with another sensor, which might require off-nadir pointing at angles of up to 16 degrees. To resolve multiple mission goals and sensor requirements, detailed knowledge of the sensitivity of sensor performance to these aspects of mission design is required.   This research used a radiative transfer model to investigate the sensitivity of forest height estimates to footprint diameter, off-nadir pointing and their interaction over a range of forest canopy properties. An individual-based forest model was used to simulate stands of mixed conifer forest in the Tahoe National Forest (Northern California, USA) and stands of deciduous forests in the Bartlett Experimental Forest (New Hampshire, USA). Waveforms were simulated for stands generated by a forest succession model using footprint diameters of 20 m to 70 m. Off-nadir angles of 0 to 16 degrees were considered for a 25 m diameter footprint diameter.   Footprint diameters in the range of 25 m to 30 m were optimal for estimates of maximum forest height (R-2 of 0.95 and RMSE of 3 m). As expected, the contribution of vegetation height to the vertical extent of the waveform decreased with larger footprints, while the contribution of terrain slope increased. Precision of estimates decreased with an increasing off-nadir pointing angle, but off-nadir pointing had less impact on height estimates in deciduous forests than in coniferous forests. When pointing off-nadir, the decrease in precision was dependent on local incidence angle (the angle between the off-nadir beam and a line normal to the terrain surface)which is dependent on the off-nadir pointing angle, terrain slope, and the difference between the laser pointing azimuth and terrain aspect; the effect was larger when the sensor was aligned with the terrain azimuth but when aspect and azimuth are opposed, there was virtually no effect on R-2 or RMSE. A second effect of off-nadir pointing is that the laser beam will intersect individual crowns and the canopy as a whole from a different angle which had a distinct effect on the precision of lidar estimates of height, decreasing R-2 and increasing RMSE, although the effect was most pronounced for coniferous crowns.

Diagnostic spectral features of HCs are linked to their chemical composition and fundamental molecular vibrations (SWIR-TIR features), as well as overtones and combinations of these vibrations (VNIR-SWIR). These features allow for the characterization of oil, oil on water and emulsified oil. This work shows the results of lab and field spectral measurements of 17 petroleum samples yielded from key, oil-rich sedimentary basins in Brazil. Measurements comprised reflectance data (VNIR- SWIR), Attenuated Total Reflectance (AIR), Directional Hemispherical Reflectance (DHR), and emissivity data (TIR). These spectra were analyzed by multivariate techniques, such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least-Square analysis (PLS). The experimental results indicate that for the VNIR-SWIR range: (i) spectral features can be recognized for crude oil, emulsified oil and oil on ocean water; (ii) different oil types can be qualitatively distinguished based on these features (i.e. light or heavy), even considering oil on water; (iii) the same applies for oil measurements simulated at the spectral resolution of hyperspectral (357-bands/ProSpecTIR) and multispectral (9-bands/ASTER) sensors. Within TIR wavelengths (3-14 mu m), typical HC spectral features can also be resolved and oil types qualitatively discriminated using PCA/PLS, including both full-resolution spectra and spectra resampled to hyperspectral sensor (128-bands/SEBASS). However, despite the fact that oil emissivity is always lower than that of water, such separation seems unfeasible using 8-12 mu m TIR features only; emissivity spectra are essentially flat for all samples in this interval. This research demonstrated that oil can be qualitatively distinguished based on both VNIR-SWIR and TIR spectroscopy data, with important implications for remote off-shore oil exploration and classification of oil leakages.

Input data is derived from a historical topographic map based on airborne visible imagery and more recent WorldView-1 panchromatic imagery, as well as an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) digital elevation model (DEM). A non-parametric best-fit model approach using a Monte Carlo simulation is used to derive the membership functions for moulin location based on three independent variables - elevation, slope and aspect - and to test for the robustness of the model. We determine that there is a topographic setting independent of time that favors the development of moulins in this region. Using the membership functions, and an optimal alpha cut derived for 1985, we could correctly predict the locations of -88% of the moulins in 2008-09. The model accounts for increased surface melt in 2008-09 in comparison to 1985. Our results demonstrate the potential of a fuzzy set based approach to improve models of ice sheet hydrology in Western Greenland, by providing more reliable spatial distributions of entry points of meltwater into the ice based on remotely sensed datasets of the ice surface, which are readily available.

Even though the imaging mechanisms for SAR and MODIS-Aqua remote sensing are different, the sand ridges are shown to have exactly the same patterns in images from both sensors. Therefore, the location, extension and coverage of the ocean sand ridges can be detected and cross-examined by both SAR and MODIS-Aqua observations. Satellite images show quite different sand ridge distribution pattern from the published bathymetry map (based on in situ data) that shows six sand ridges in the area. 10 finger-shaped sand ridges are identified from satellite observations. The tidal-current/sand-ridge interaction driven physical and optical changes are assessed and evaluated. The existence of sand ridges causes enhanced water diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(490) and elevated normalized water-leaving radiance at the red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The sea surface over the sand ridges experiences significant seasonal variability of water turbidity and shows remarkable differences from nearby ocean regions. During winter, K-d(490) values are about 2-3 m(-1) over the ridges, while the maximum K-d(490) in the neighboring oceans is approximately 1.5 m(-1). In summer, the enhancement of the sea surface turbidity is less significant than that which occurs in winter.

It is now growingly admitted that the NIR represents a potential optical source of unambiguous information about suspended sediments in turbid waters, thence the need for better understanding the NIR optical behaviour of such waters. It has recently been proposed (Ruddick et al., Limnology and Oceanography. 51, 1167-1179, 2006) that the variability in the shape of the surface ocean reflectance spectrum in the NIR is negligible in turbid waters. In the present study, we show, based on both in situ and remote sensing data, that the shape of the ocean reflectance spectrum in the NIR does vary in turbid to extremely turbid waters. Space-borne ocean reflectance data were collected using 3 different sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS/Aqua and MERIS) over the Amazon, Mackenzie and Rio de la Plata turbid river plumes during extremely clear atmospheric conditions so that reliable removal of gas and aerosol effects on reflectance could be achieved. In situ NIR reflectance data were collected in different European estuaries where extremely turbid waters were found. In both data sets, a flattening of the NIR reflectance spectrum with increasing turbidity was observed. The ratio of reflectances at 765 nm and 865 nm, for instance, varied from ca. 2 down to 1 in our in situ data set, while a constant value of 1.61 had been proposed based on theory in a previous study. Radiative transfer calculations were performed using a range of realistic values for the seawater inherent optical properties, to determine the possible causes of variations in the shape of the NIR reflectance spectrum. Based on these simulations, we found that the most significant one was the gradual increase in the contribution of suspended sediments to the color of surface waters, which often leads to the flattening of the reflectance spectrum. Changes in the scattering and absorption properties of particles also contributed to variations in the shape of the NIR surface ocean reflectance spectrum. The impact of such variations on the interpretation of ocean color data is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Doron, Maeva] ACRI ST, F-06904 Sophia Antipolis, France.

The model is aimed to estimate the monthly average hourly PAR in a tropical environment. This model represents a physical relation of PAR incident on the earth\'s surface and satellite-derived earth-atmospheric albedo together with the absorption and scattering coefficients of various atmospheric constituents. The earth-atmospheric albedo was obtained from the Multifunctional Transport Satellite-1R (MTSAT-1R). The absorption of PAR by water vapor, an important process for the tropics, was computed from the ambient temperature and relative humidity. The absorption of PAR by aerosols was estimated by using the visibility data and aerosol optical properties obtained from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) of NASA in this region. The total column ozone from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument onboard of AURA satellite (OMI/AURA) was used for the estimation of the absorption of PAR by ozone. The model was validated against the monthly average hourly PAR from measurements at four solar radiation measuring stations situated in the tropical environment of Thailand. The values of the monthly average hourly PAR estimated from the model and those obtained from the measurement were in good agreement, with the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) of 9.8% and 0.6%, respectively. After the validation, the model was employed to estimate the monthly average hourly PAR over Thailand using a 4-year period of data from MTSAT-1R and other ancillary surface data. Values of the monthly average hourly PAR were presented as maps showing the geographical distribution of PAR. These maps reveal the diurnal and seasonal variation of PAR over the country.

Using the Al Jabal al Akhdar mountains in northern Oman as an example, our objectives were to analyse the availability and spatial distribution of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and the extent and causes of vegetation changes during the last decades with a remote sensing approach. A combination of destructive and non-destructive biomass measurements by life-form specific allometric equations was used to identify the ANPP of the ground vegetation (<50 cm) and the leaf and twig biomass of phanerophytes. The ANPP differed significantly among the life forms and the different plant communities, and the biomass of the sparsely vegetated ground was more than 50 times lower (mean = 0.22 t DM ha(-1)) than the biomass of phanerophytes (mean = 12.3 t DM ha(-1)). Among the different vegetation indices calculated NDVI proved to be the best predictor for rangeland biomass.   Temporal trend analysis of Landsat satellite images from 1986 to 2009 was conducted using a pixel-based least square regression with the annual maximum Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVImax) as a dependent variable. Additionally, linear relationships of NDVImax and annual rainfall along the time series were calculated. The extent of human-induced changes was analysed using the residual trends method. A strongly significant negative biomass trend detected for 83% of the study area reflected a decrease in annual rainfall but even without clear evidence of deforestation of trees and shrubs, human-induced vegetation degradation due to settlement activities were also important.

A method to retrieve cloud properties from nighttime SEVIRI measurements is described in this paper. The method is applicable to single-layer water clouds over sea surfaces and it is based on the inversion of a forward theoretical radiative transfer model, that simulates the radiances reaching the SEVIRI infrared detectors from a specified configuration of the earth-cloud-atmosphere system. This model accounts for scattering and absorption processes in the assumed horizontally homogeneous adiabatic cloud layer. For the inversion of this model, artificial neural networks techniques have been used in this work. The main advantage that these techniques provide is their low computational cost, which makes them suitable for the implementation of operational retrieval procedures. Results obtained by the proposed method are compared with the values provided by the CloudSat derived 2B-TAU product, and those derived from NOM-AVHRR nighttime imagery, obtaining good agreements.

Earth observation data sets are an important source of information that allow for systematic monitoring of the entire biome. Landsat imagery, provided free of charge by the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) enable consistent and timely forest cover updates. However, irregular image acquisition within parts of the boreal biome coupled with an absence of atmospherically corrected data hamper regional-scale monitoring efforts using Landsat imagery. A method of boreal forest cover and change mapping using Landsat imagery has been developed and tested within European Russia between circa year 2000 and 2005. The approach employs a multi-year compositing methodology adapted for incomplete annual data availability, within-region variation in growing season length and frequent cloud cover. Relative radiometric normalization and cloud/shadow data screening algorithms were employed to create seamless image composites with remaining cloud/shadow contamination of less than 0.5% of the total composite area. Supervised classification tree algorithms were applied to the time-sequential image composites to characterize forest cover and gross forest loss over the study period. Forest cover results when compared to independently-derived samples of Landsat data have high agreement (overall accuracy of 89%, Kappa of 0.78), and conform with official forest cover statistics of the Russian government. Gross forest cover loss regional-scale mapping results are comparable with individual Landsat image pair change detection (overall accuracy of 98%, Kappa of 0.71). The gross forest cover loss within European Russia 2000-2005 is estimated to be 2210 thousand hectares, and constitutes a 1.5% reduction of year 2000 forest cover. At the regional scale, the highest proportional forest cover loss is estimated for the most populated regions (Leningradskaya and Moskovskaya Oblast). Our results highlight the forest cover depletion around large industrial cities as the hotspot of forest cover change in European Russia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We present a method to map annual LULC at a regional spatial scale with source data and processing techniques that permit scaling to broader spatial and temporal scales, while maintaining a consistent classification scheme and accuracy. Using the Dry Chaco ecoregion in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay as a test site, we derived a suite of predictor variables from 2001 to 2007 from the MODIS 250 m vegetation index product (MOD13Q1). These variables included: annual statistics of red, near infrared, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), phenological metrics derived from EVI time series data, and slope and elevation. For reference data, we visually interpreted percent cover of eight classes at locations with high-resolution QuickBird imagery in Google Earth. An adjustable majority cover threshold was used to assign samples to a dominant class. When compared to field data, we found this imagery to have georeferencing error <5% the length of a MODIS pixel, while most class interpretation error was related to confusion between agriculture and herbaceous vegetation. We used the Random Forests classifier to identify the best sets of predictor variables and percent cover thresholds for discriminating our LULC classes. The best variable set included all predictor variables and a cover threshold of 80%. This optimal Random Forests was used to map LULC for each year between 2001 and 2007, followed by a per-pixel, 3-year temporal filter to remove disallowed LULC transitions. Our sequence of maps had an overall accuracy of 79.3%, producer accuracy from 51.4% (plantation) to 95.8% (woody vegetation), and user accuracy from 58.9% (herbaceous vegetation) to 100.0% (water). We attributed map class confusion to limited spectral information, sub-pixel spectral mixing, georeferencing error and human error in interpreting reference samples. We used our maps to assess woody vegetation change in the Dry Chaco from 2002 to 2006, which was characterized by rapid deforestation related to soybean and planted pasture expansion. This method can be easily applied to other regions or continents to produce spatially and temporally consistent information on annual LULC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, field measurements were applied to develop ocean color satellite algorithms of phytoplankton pigments from in-water radiometry measurements. The match-up comparisons showed that the satellite-derived pigments from our algorithms agree reasonably well (e.g. 30-55% of uncertainty for SeaWiFS and 37-50% for MODIS-Aqua) to field data, with better agreement (e.g. 30-38% of uncertainty for SeaWiFS and 39-44% for MODIS-Aqua) for pigments abundant in diatoms. The seasonal and spatial variations of satellite-derived phytoplankton biomarker pigments, such as fucoxanthin, which is abundant in diatoms, peridinin, which is found only in peridinin-containing dinoflagellates, and zeaxanthin, which is primarily from cyanobacteria in coastal waters, revealed that higher densities of diatoms are more likely to occur on the inner shelf and during winter-spring and obscure other abundant phytoplankton groups. However, relatively higher densities of other phytoplankton, such as dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, are likely to occur on the mid- to outer-continental shelf and during summer. Seasonal variation of riverine discharge may play an important role in stimulating algal blooms, in particular diatoms, while higher abundances of cyanobacteria coincide with warmer water temperatures and lower nutrient concentrations.

The PSInSAR analysis, based on SAR data acquired by ERS-1/2 sensors during the 1992-2001 time interval and by the Radarsat sensor during 2003-2007. identifies displacement patterns over wide areas with high spatial resolution. GPS data acquired by the Neapolitan Volcanic Continuous GPS network provide detailed ground velocity information of specific sites. The satellite-derived data allow us to characterize the deformation pattern that affected the Campi Flegrei caldera during two recent subsidence (1992-1999) and uplift (2005-2006) phases. PSInSAR results show the re-activation of the caldera ring-faults, intra-caldera faults. and eruptive fissures. We discuss the results in the light of the available volcanological, structural and geophysical data and propose a relationship between the structures activated during the recent unrest episodes and those responsible for the recent (<3.8-4 ka) volcanism. The combined interpretation of the collected data show that (a) the caldera consists of two sectors separated by a N-S striking faulting zone and (b) the intra-caldera NW-SE faults and eruptive fissures in the central-eastern sector re-activated during the studied unrest episodes and represent possible pathways for the ascent of magma and/or gas to the surface. In this sector, maximum horizontal strain, recent volcanism (3.8-4 ka), active degassing and seismicity concentrate. The fault re-activation is related to the dynamics of the caldera and not to tectonic stress. The deformation fields of the uplift and subsidence episodes are consistent with hydrothermal processes and degassing from a magmatic reservoir that is significantly smaller than the large (similar to 40 km(3)) magma chamber responsible for the caldera formation. We provide evidence that the monitoring of the horizontal and vertical components of deformation improves the identification of active, aseismic faults. Accordingly, we suggest that future ground deformation models should include the re-activation of the detected structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
